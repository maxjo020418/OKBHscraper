hqdyjdc : The Washington Monument on the "BBC Circle" might suggest a Washington-based city, but this isn't really the plan!

It's going to be a state capitol based on a mix of DFW and OKC, although the view corridors and parks around the Capitol (eg. the Congress Avenue corridor) will take at least some influence from the L'Enfant Plan, as well as various aspects of the City Beautiful Movement.  This will be the central business district, so there will be plenty of skyscrapers, starting a block-or-two off of the Capitol view corridors, of course. I might have some Vancouverist influences as well.  My plan for Leighton involved a city on the Southern Plains with a mix of sprawl and idealized urbanism in the central city; keep in mind that DC does urbanism *really* well.

Those westbound views of Kirsten Bowen Parkway will soon have a variety of skyscrapers coming up to the left-hand (south side) of the corridor. Kirsten Bowen Parkway itself will have parks lining the corridor, also connected to (and essentially part of) the riverfront parks.  


Also, the backstory behind those "drive with caution" signs on the Kirsten Bowen Parkway: drivers in Leighton often speed along the corridor, and the minimal number of signalized intersections (and grade separations) seem to encourage drivers to treat the Bowen as a freeway (something it is not)...
hqe128w : i hope you know what that stands for
hqe39m7 : References to the British BBC weren’t intended, if that’s what you meant… I gave that traffic circle a nickname based on the names of the streets intersecting there, and given the names I gave to those roads, it made sense and sounded like a plausible nickname a resident might give to the intersection.
hqe3ckz : thats not what i meant LMAO
hqfr4lp : Did you mean the forms of urbanism I'm planning to use?

hqdyi7g : Move it! And you just move the two nodes (one overground one underground) to where you like.

Fine road anarchy, set road mode to tunnel and go.
hqf9aar : pretty sure you can do that in vanilla.
hqedhzk : Yep Fine Road Anarchy in tunnel mode and probably smooth slope checked too.
hqfq2kt : Fine Road Tools allows you to specify tunnel / ground level / elevated where you specifically want them, and allow you to explicitly set the height of your roads.

Anarchy and MoveIt are useful, but Fine Road Tools is what you need to create this.

(Fine Road Tools is different from Road Anarchy. What other people are describing is the functionality of Fine Road Tools. Most people who have one, have both and may confuse the two.)

hqe099i : Yes, lots. Here are two:

1. Infinite Demand ([https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1522785644](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1522785644)) does just what you want.
2. Demand Master ([https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=409776678](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=409776678&searchtext=rci+demand)) allows you to choose the amount of demand and freeze the values.
hqeb95l : As the other guy said, but beware that problems such as having not enough workers or shopper etc. will still occur, so maybe get no abandonment mod if you don’t want your buildings to keep being abandoned.
hqfd4np : The game runs on demand so beware that it’s going to create the same number of problems it solves.
hqgcpl5 : [reading this post](https://skylines.fandom.com/wiki/Zoning) should help understand the mechanics of the demands and once you know how they work it’s quite easy to manipulate them to your favour and never really have demand issues.
hqfpl10 : Agree. These mods make it all too easy to get your RICO out of balance which is going to result in all kinds of problems.

You can also easily get surges of people moving into your city at once which will clog up your road network. Then you will have tons of uneducated children flooding your schools, and a lack of educated workers. And then you get a massive death wave as they all start dying at the same time.

Be very wary applying these.

hqed80r : I never check the username before i zoom in, but your creation's usage of unpopular vanilla assets is always a giveaway! Awesome work, how did you paint the golf course?
hqf0m8y : Burn it down and build high density housing!!! (Looks nice though!)
hqf9uhn : Looks great!

Shame for a golf course surrounded by a river to have no views of the river though!
hqfyzpi : You guys are crazy good at this game. Every time I give it a go my citizens just leave town and I’m left with boarded up houses and districts. Oh and debt, a very huge debt
hqfckbh : What mod did you use for the golf course? I'm having troubles finding one I like.
hqgojza : /r/nongolfers/
hqfb8oq : What did I miss? Amazing work once again Teddy.
hqfwr32 : How did you make the ponds? I've struggled for so long to do that, but the water either disappears, or I need to raise the water level across the map.
hqgom7f : what map is this?
hqgsl7o : That is pretty. Thank you for sharing it.
hqhe608 : Looks both beautiful and terrifying! It's a sunny day, and the river is up to the brim already?
hqhm2xz : FORE!
hqj2ct3 : This is awesome! Well done. 

I feel Parks DLC should have had golf courses. Also customised cemeteries (as cemeteries as usually quite large in cities).
hqirras : I'm currently stuck with the vanilla, plopping down trees ane vegetation one by one. Was there a mod you used to add all that green? Would love for my city to look more like this
hqeihgm : <3 thanks Alexpetrov! Basically surface painter and a map theme setup with similar but different textures for grass and ruined. Also used gravel for the bunkers here and vanilla destruction decals, painted light green, for the.. uhmm.. greens lol.
hqg396j : AMEN!
hqf8n2b : town could use some high density transit oriented development /s
hqfuk5z : Was about to say this, too, some of the world's most beautiful golf courses are very dynamic with their surrounding bodies of water such as Pebble Beach!
hqg2t8c : There's some really good beginners' videos on YouTube that talk about how to start a game off on the right foot and manage things. I couldn't play this game until I watched a couple.
hqg3fe4 : surface painter mostly and theme mixer to setup a good terrain theme for painting!
hqg5upq : Small capacity watersources basically, carefully placed in holes i made with terraforming tools
hqhf4jq : Murky Coast i think it called
hqj62lq : Nice ideas! I like doing large cemeteries too.
hqj6b03 : Forest brush mod might be what youre looking for, gives you  the ability to paint a forest with a variety of different trees.
hqgepas : Maybe it's for people like me who will absolutely put their ball in water if they can see it
hqgfx69 : Haha, same here. Times like that you just need to try to be glad that you got to walk outside a while :)
===============

hqexdtp : It probably has something to do with IT cluster as they don't use trucks for goods delivery. Most of the time the warehouses just fill up from these goods gradually like they should, but some specific chain of events seems to trigger this bug.
hqeli9f : I think it is a bug for the game. I have the same issue (PS5) where the warehouse for zoned goods just fills. Deleting the warehouse will fix the problem. All other warehouses appear to work correctly.

hqfsqnf : City Planner Plays, but mainly his vanilla city Verde Beach. Clearwater County is a bit too much modding for me. 
I really like Overcharged Eggs new city as it’s not super heavily modded.
And some of twodollarstwenty content is also quite nice.
hqefizx : advanced plugins trickery, using stuff in creative ways, extreme detailers.
hqf7aci : Back in the day I used to watch Strictoaster. Nowadays its City Planner plays
hqelalc : City Planner Plays. I’m trying to watch Biffa’s content from the very beginning but it’s hard because his cities are a mess. Lol. I do like the vanilla or very lightly modded stuff the best though.
hqehp7p : City Planner Plays and sometimes Biffa
hqejhnf : Vanilla/console content!
hqfjdcx : Biffa. His attempts at fixing traffic are entertaining. Also any 4 way intersection i haven't seen before.
hqfk44b : Cant believe im going to be first to mention ImperialJedi....especially for unmoded play through
hqewvk4 : CPP, Overcharged Egg and Biffa (though I mostly just watch his "fix" videos) mostly. I also really enjoy the 5B1C (5 builders, 1 city) series.  
  
Egg just started his new Ilos series (also hia first modded build) and it's looking to be absolutely amazing.
hqegltt : The only YouTube stuff I ever watch is road hierarchy explanations
hqerukq : i'd rather just play it.
hqeyz4e : Vanilla, i hate mods deeply
hqga8xb : I like a variety of different ones that i look at for my own building; 

1. starting your city (for future planning)
2. Areas of different Industries, how Others Set It up

I cant think of anything else, i am sure i have others but there is a guy who is a REAL life city planner, this are fraking awesome!
hqi4ks1 : When I really want to be blown away by a level of detailing and realism that discourages me from ever thinking I will be any good at this game, I watch Akraus.
hqmdi1b : Non cities skylines creators, and kibitz
hqh9sfe : Vanilla
hqfxxmo : As a console player, Verde Beach made me completely rethink how I was playing the game. I like Clearwater County too, but mostly because it reminds me of the Midwest towns I’m used to seeing.
hqgifk0 : City planner plays has amazing content, I like watching Verde Beach from time to time but it stresses me out sometimes because without mods you can't make the city look "realistic". I've watched twodollarstwenty on 5B1C!
hqgi5hs : Interesting! What's the "advanced plugins trickery" used for?
hqgsc5h : "advanced plugins trickery, using stuff in creative ways, extreme detail" have u been watching my twitch perchance? ;)
hqg88o7 : Biffa has definitely been distracted while recording lately but his skill growth over the years is inspirational.
hqgiu5g : The city I like the most from Biffa is his current one (modded) He's put in so much effort through the year but stopped posting regularly. I wished he could have completed the entire map before the end of the year!
hqei90k : Same!
hqginds : Clearwater county is nice! I like to because the city is spaced out and city planner plays use the " realistic population mode" so it makes the city feel real and not all cramped like big cities.
hqhd3jg : something [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l41Yxbjeyk&list=PLvUltnTgrMOMktcnKm-b3sBs-bcfdpztK&index=31), I aware of that mod since it's inception but never knew it can do THOSE.
hqgj0yd : Yeah, I have noticed that too! Idk why tho, this years city was going so well I thought he was going to finish it but Biffa is definitely starting a new city soon :(
hqho5jv : I actually really love the new eminent domain mod too. The game wants you to go back and fix things but in real life, sometimes those things would be nearly impossible to fix. Having a cost involved does at least add a small barrier to ripping out zoning and redoing portions of the city. I’m actually really curious to see how that affects upzoning to higher density if he chooses to.

Also I know the C2 doesn’t go up Elizabeth St, I haven’t figured out the dead end yet I’m sorry
hqezhn8 : Now I want a mod that automatically turns the street to Christmas settings :D
hqgpkz1 : I recognised that E class melbourne tram
hqezwyg : that’s so awesome man, literally looks real
hqfrbd4 : Wow that’s really impressive, good job!

hqjnasg : No, but if somebody puts crazy effort into it, it might be doable.

rr7bex
hqejnqq : It means a public transport route is incomplete. Do you have buses there?
hqgl5j8 : It means that something is either not quite reaching the boarder of the road, a transportation line is disconnected, there is no outlet to a dead end or there is some kind of "I'm just not going to cooperate" with placement. I hate that icon lol
hqfetp8 : The building is not connected to the road. Maybe a glitch? I’ve had it happen to a school while using the move it mod.
hqenz9q : no, that's weird I haven't even put any public transpo yet
hqffmge : No
hqfy74p : I'd go with either nudging the building with move it or redoing that section of road
hqepdxu : Go into the route view & flick through all the tabs. Maybe a route got created somehow?
hqerse4 : Yep Got it thanks! Looks like a train line was under there!
===============
rr7oiy
hqen1ir : I can see you increased the corner offset for that node, perhaps that puts it too close to another node on Ulmen Allee and they get stuck there. pathfinding goes funny when nodes are too close together.
hqep5b5 : It's caused by limit of the game, you made node longer than 64m using node controller, make it less than 64m.
Btw, it's already fixed in Node Controller Renewed
hqeo98i : They’re just partying 🥳
hqep81r : Try Making ur intersection a little smaller with Node Controller. When you have really stretched intersections, that may happen. It worked for me, I Hope that fix yours as well.

And if you have others large intersections, I recommend to check all of them. At least with me, that happens Very often
hqf0lw6 : Make sure to also use TM:PE's option to reset stuck cims.
hqf5jej : It's their civil right to gather, they're free people!
hqeo3gw : Try building a pedestrian path over the road where the crossing should be. Or delete and rebuild the road.
hqetj3q : You have to enable the no loitering policy for your city
hqf6rgj : The engine of this game is just so broken that after about 2000 hours, I can't play it anymore. I really hope the next version has a great engine. They still have such vast potential, and I really want to see that potential realized.
hqfuu0q : Hit it with a meteor to teach them a lesson
hqeljml : As the titel sais, I can't do anything about it. They all just go there, standing around forever. I can "delete" them, but they'll come back and start to gather again. Does anybody had a similar experience?
hqf63ov : They’re hanging out
hqf6tap : they might all be waitin for a taxi but you just don’t have enough in your city, my cims do this sometimes and even stand in the middle of the road but is usually cuz they’re waiting for a taxi which i never put enough of
hqfa5pa : Are there no civil rights there? Just let them be
hqfme6y : Don't drag the Node Controller's offset till the preview box turn from green to red (basically that segment become too tiny) - weird things might happens with the AI.
hqfquoz : What road are you using to the right? Exactly what I need for my city. Could you please link or write the name of it. Thanks. Beautiful city by the way!
hqfssni : Ehat mods are you using?
hqftdlk : I had the same issues. Fixed itself after I removed all my road type mods and added them back in one by one. 

But I think we others have said the large turn radius may be a cause.
hqg7emb : Nice buildings, where did you get them? name or link would be very helpful
hqgbin3 : It's a riot, drive the limo and throw money at them!
hqh4a8e : The node is too stretched for the pedestrians to keep walking alongside it. The easiest fix I found is to lay down a pedestrian path where the sidewalk should be - the invisible ones are especially useful for this.
hqh5c3g : With a couple of police units and a water canon or two you should be able to disperse that crowd quickly and efficiently!
hqhalg7 : Your node mod has made the cross walk dissappear, try a vanilla Street for that intersection
hqhhiex : I've seen this before in GTA but normally they're all in Orange.

If you run over them all at once you get bonus points.
hqhx9xp : Unrelated, but is that Japanese house pack?
hqi2pfy : What is the tram road called?
hqjapwq : Use mods to remove the option to cross the street there.
hqjgq44 : I want to detail that intersection so bad 🤓

...sorry, what was the question?
hqfgjyz : If you scroll in and watch the traffic lights i'm pretty sure it's because the pedestrian crossing light never switches to green. This happened to me when I was using the 4 lane tram road. I was lucky and was able to downgrade to a two lane tram because I had moved my stops anyway.  And the downgrade fixed it.

Someone else had this issue and that didn't fix it. I don't know if they ever got it fixed. But deleting all involved roads and placing them again might help.

Also i was playing on 100% vanilla, pc.
hqfiw74 : American city, with japanese houses, and german street names... Is that a Man in the High Castle reference??
hqgud9t : I would delete the entire stretch of road and the houses and replace them.
hqep770 : Interestingly, when I move the node they all move around to the new position. They just .. love to stand there apparently lol
hqep25t : Yeah the angle is prett steep, that's true. The nodes are pretty far away, I tried to move them around but this changed nothing apparently.
hqer2eb : I already use the renewed version of Node Controller, and the corner offset is only at 42
hqgbajt : Looks like an anti-mask protest in my home town. About the right size, density, and location.
hqer6yj : It worked! I did fiddle around and at a certain point the whole crowd started moving and now doesn't gather anymore there. Now my intersection is ugly but the party crowd is gone.
hqizv7h : Good idea, thank you!
hqeotff : Tried that too, some people actually will start moving, others .. don't. They still gather tho.
hqfewrf : The pedestrian path is what I did to solve this when it happened to me.
hqf1cjw : 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
hqizz06 : Same, I play the game since the very beginning and I see so many opportunities. Can't wait for a C:S2
hqem46d : Can you add a crossing?
hqhq3nu : I had very frequent experience with this in SPUI and it massively causes performance hit. 

When node are stretched, pedestrian crossing is unusable, but path finding will keep sending people there and the people are waiting to cross the roads forever there. 

Just disable crossing at that junction and add pedestrian crossing at other place nearby, use node controller if needed to do that.

hqfjigr : This is the most german behaviour I've seen on this sub lol
hqfax7u : Fascinating
hqfv3xi : Send the military police and shoot them onsite for illegal loitering.
hqg6pnz : Ive had this exact issue, it is indeed that the corner offset is to large for pedestrian pathfinding tovwork correctly. I think this issue starts to appear when you offset more than 30 or so units. Try reducing the offset or just reseting node controller setup completely and see how for you can edit the node before this happens again.
hqer6ug : Still, the reason of the problem is the big corner offset
hqqmalf : I think he meant Beta version, since only that one has a fix for that game limit.   


Corner offset value doesn't matter, "real" distance between pavement ends (where pedestrian crossing is rendered) does.  


Side effect of stuck cims is gradually slowing down simulation to the point in which either users consider it unplayable or game run out of path units required for creating new paths (they hold waypoints of path).   


Not to mention that your game will probably grind to halt once you unlock "big pile" of stuck citizens - collision detection is demanding as it has to test all cims in tiny area - game can aggregate thousands cims in one spot, from pathfinding perspective calculated path is valid, but because of distance limitation each cim invalidates path and asks for new one (in 99% cases it will get exactly the same one, because... it is valid). 

No one knows why they've added a limit there and how big distances are considered safe (won't cause issues).
hqjhsjo : Just missing a small wave of "Sick citizen" notifications.
hqez66n : So they just gathered there to admire your non-ugly intersection.

Oder sie waren verwirrt von Deinem Straßennamen-Game. Eins von beidem.
hqfeqq1 : I had the same issue as you with a very similarly steep intersection. What I ended up doing to resolve it is I created a path between the two places my cims were sitting patiently at and moved it as close as possible to the avenue so it didn't look to hideous.

It worked. :)
hqhprd9 : You can disable cross walk in tmpe and they'll disperse.
hqemkxm : There is, it's just not visible because I hide the vanilla markings. I tried it with and without crossing, no difference. They all want to different locations.
hqj1jdv : I'm using it too actually. But I noticed that the building can't level up. I can see progress, but then it is back to lv1. Is it the same with yours?
hqgd1ph : Or British. Everyone knows they like a good queue. :)
hqi9gdv : Just so you know, I think your comment is funny
hqera08 : I did fiddle around a bit at a certain point the crowd started moving. So thank you! It did solve the problem!
hqj285k : Yes, it's all just level one buildings. If you need you can dublicate them with building themes, but you have to do it all by hand. So .. I just accepted my big lvl.1 town haha
hqh3470 : While that is the case, these folks aren't queued; they're bunched up. Brits HATE that.
hqh4js5 : Hmm. You're absolutely correct. I rescind my happy Brits comment and replace it with a Brits with pitchforks comment.

hqflv8l : All the abandoned buildings 😭
hqfn5o5 : I remember my first city.... Then I discovered mods, now I change cities Everytime there's a tiny backup.... Good times, nice city btw
hqflgsu : What map is this
hqfy7dh : If you ask my opinion, I'd grab that highway that crosses your city starting from the northwest, and make small diamond interchanges and avenues so traffic can enter in different points. I feel that one roundabout at the beginning and two other intersections absorb too much traffic.
hqgi12x : Helpful tip for making money in the game (not that you need it right now): you can set all tax rates to 12% instead of the default 9% and nobody will fuss about it and you generate a lot more income.
hqgkt8v : Looks like Liberty city
hqg1h4h : What dlc do you have? Do you have those train stations and piers (I don’t)?
hqgx3pr : Modeled after the map of GTA4 by any chance?
hqibjgv : How do you put labels?
hqews21 : 58%💀
hqj2h1v : Traffic flow is such a stupid metric in my opinion
hqfpndz : We’ve all been there lmao
hqfzgw0 : I built 3 cargo railway stations. Still the commercial buildings don't have enough goods to sell apparently. What are the people consuming that is in such a short supply lol.
hqjdjzw : I don’t see why I have this problem with abandoned buildings too, I keep the green bar for housing demand in roughly the middle as I find that the higher the demand shown on those bars. The more the population grows? If I deplete those colour bars so there is. I demand, the population shrinks
hqkblxg : I don't even save cities anymore lol
hqg0p3o : The highway only connects to the roundabout tho. Most of the traffic is on the big S shaped six lane road going through the middle of the right side of the city. I built another six lane road to help with the traffic. It did turn some parts green but it still mostly red on the traffic map. And the industrial area is almost entirely red💀.
hqgtoqb : Is that a GTA reference?
hqg1la7 : Just the base game. No dlcs or mods for now
hqipzbm : No actually. I just kept on building lol. Coincidence
hqiqe41 : Zoning the areas
hqf1hei : Ouch, build some good interchanges incase traffic is on highway. Also download TM:PE labs to improve it a bit
hqf21ns : Sounds like u need some better spaghetti
hqhbbdx : The biggest mistake i did was not having good public transport, buses for low demand, trams for medium, and subways connecting the main parts of the city.
hqg5be0 : It could be because the congestion is so bad that delivery trucks despawn before dropping goods off.
hqg0y6k : I did this after taking the screenshot. The bottom 4 lane road on the right side  is now a six lane.
hqiqxp6 : Yeah
hqf3dbp : I am trying to play vanilla for now. Will try modding when i understand the base game 💀💀
hqf8usq : Ok, for good vanilla traffic flow, make elevated or underground highways through the city, make them cut by main roads and give them many access points, the highways should cross each other on the x and y axes and make sure they are interconnected, any traffic problems on the highway are much more easily solved.
hqfz82r : I didn't know you could build underground lol. But thanks i will try it
hqg3q8r :  No problem

hqerl1d : **The River Kingdom of Nadi** \- Built over the natural springs of Niru, the Kingdom of Nadi consists of 4 surrounding villages of Bele (an agricultural town), Taila (an oil town), Adiru (an ore town) and the forest town of Aranya. The inner circular city of Hana (will) consists of wealthy noblemen as well as scholars from around world who want to study the properties of the spring.

**The Build**: After multiple attempts to build the concentric islands on a flowing river by diverting the river to a makeshift dam, I tried to connect two rivers to flow through the circular kingdom centre. After that failed, I decided to use a separate water system to pump water from the river and fill the pits using fresh water outlets, with dams on either side to maintain a steady water level within the pits.

Terraforming the circular islands and pits alone took me 10ish hours over multiple sessions, so I decided to leave that alone for now and work on the towns of Bele and Taila.

**Suggestions Needed**: I need suggestions on what to fill in the concentric islands with, I’m leaning towards, IT Cluster in the smaller circler, high density green cities in the outer circle, and green cities lower density surrounding the centre islands. I’d also appreciate suggestions on which monuments or unique buildings to plop in.
hqhc3ch : Map?
hqf2asm : Ah yes , river kingdom of river  ( Nadi means river in Hindi )
hqf8j60 : I like that density plan, although instead of low density green, I'd put in either high rise ban high density, or low density commercial, it fits better with the theme of the place. Unique buildings should be an observation tower on the outside edge, an Aviation club in the center, then stuff like the aquarium and the expo center in the middle.
hqjbb59 : Windfield from the Parklife DLC
hqf5bfd : I always use a random language from google translate to name my towns based on their unique features. Quite unoriginal I know, for this build I've used a language called Kannada (which on googling is a Dravidian language spoken predominantly by the people of Karnataka in the southwestern region of India). Example, forest translates to Aranya, the town of my forest industry based village.
hqfsvvy : Having the high rise ban on high density is a good idea! That way there'll be a nice height gradient from the centre to the other rim, instead of a sudden drop, cheers!

hqf831z : I really don't see anything wrong, besides, with traffic manager, the things that would suck in vanilla become OP
hqfc23z : I've made a city on this map. I put a dam next to the bridge but never got it working properly. The most time I've spent building a city. 

Looking good
hqfuqst : Where do all the tunnels by the southwest corner lead?

Also, now that you have traffic manager, I'd suggest using the magic of filtered permeability and low speeds to downgrade those stroads in non-industrial areas into local streets and, as long as you have other ways to get around your city, watch your traffic flow soar while also spending a lot less on roads.
hqgfgki : Switch up angles (make em follow geographical features) and add some more development next to highways.
Normally highways aren’t straight, even in a grid-defined city.
hqgteu2 : Focus less on grids. BYW, whats the traffic flow?
hqjoysm : Happy to see the original neighborhoods are still around. We all thought the area by the beach was gonna get demolished for a stadium complex.

hqf8pfh : I actually just added the mod a few days ago and I was blown away with all the stuff you can do with it, especially changing road arrows
hqg8xyb : I have a massive European city roughly based off Bournemouth on this map.
hqfhtja : I think I'll give it a try. Was the current too low to generate enough power?
hqfxmeg : One runs across to the residential area north of the city and the other goes to another island off map where the power production and inland water treatment is located. The area is hilly so instead of building the road on land I made a tunnel through the hill

Alright, I'll give that a try, thanks
hqgigtf : Alright, I've been meaning to do that but akways end up always building straight roads. I'll start curving them
hqiojvd : Not good, I think about 65. I tried turning off the dispawning and it dropped to 30. Do people actually use that option?
hqf9hhd : Yeah, vanilla is a headache when it comes to that
hqjgc8a : Care to share? I'd love to see it!
hqfu27b : Given you start on an island, it likely never filled up because the water can just go around the other side.
hqgdjh0 : I had to raise the land on the east side of the bridge (sea north) to take in the water for the dam. Only managed to get 40/50 power out of the dam. I wouldn't bother it cost loads to build and raise the land. You could build 4 nuclear power stations for half the price it cost me. 

Looked good but that's it
hqfym9f : Ok, at least it's nothing ridiculous like the literal underground spaghetti of motorways some people build. Also, a good way to clamp down on goods traffic would be to have at least one cargo train station by the west side near all that industry.

And, it might not be of mch use while you're still on a single island, but do you have the barges mod? In a map full of rivers like this one, it's great and cheap way, at least compared to trains or motorways, of getting goods around, plus it makes your waterways look more alive.
hqlxdn4 : I do. In my main city traffic is around 75 with despawning off.
hqlxhfi : I’d also be interested to see pictures of traffic flow and hotspots if you want to share.
hqg1rwj : Lol I've been there

I've noticed the cargo station generates lots of traffic so I tried to build it as far from the industry. But I'll give that another shot
hqg2hf2 : For the cargo station, I suggest building a bit of a switchback of one-way roads leading to it, to mimick the queueing spaces for lorries that real goods stations and harbours do have. Ideally, it should look like the insde of a toster, with those loops of iron or whatever that metal is.

And with TM;PE, you can create shortcuts and ban all vehicles except service and emergency vehicles, so that they can bypass the queue of trucks. I'd also recommend using a one-lane one-way road from the workshop, so that trucks can't skip the queue, since all that lane splitting and merging only makes traffic worse.
hqg76a5 : Thanks for the detailed explanation, will definitely try that

Off to examine my toaster
hqg7z2r : In case you have a different model of toaster, I can make a post with an image of a queueing area from one of my cities and tag you on it.
hqgis1n : That would be much appreciated

hqf1cni : By building more commercial and industrial/office
hqf587v : Available jobs will draw people to move into your city. Zoning the commercial / industrial will drive residential demand.

One of the buttons in the side panel will give you some demographic information. You can use that to check employment statistics. This is another indicator that can back up what the RICO indicators are telling you.
hqfsmru : You fix it by doing what the game wants you to do. If there'sonly  commercial and industrial demand, it's likely because you have a lot of unemployed people, and no one's willingly moving to a city where everyone's out of a job. Also, if you have no residential demand, it's likely because you zoned too much too quickly, so get ready for a death wave in the near future.

Or if you don't care about having a dysfuntional city and just want it to look good, you can download the Demand Master mod and force residential demand to appear. But by forcing demand, your entire city will be throw out of balance, leading to yet more commercial and industrial demand because of the new influx of people, as well as having to spend loads more on services without the sales and industrial taxes to fund it.

And as a bonus, if you ever stop forcing demand after using Demand Master, it'll wreck your demand for a long while and you might have to sit there doing nothing for literal hours while your city recovers from the damage caused by the forced demand. And if you didn't manage to create enough jobs and services for the people that came with the forced residential demand, part of your city "recovering" will likely mean losing lots of people until your city is stable again.

If you are going for just looks, I highly recommend just comitting to it and just plopping everything with RICO or PTG.
hqgbayk : [read this](https://skylines.fandom.com/wiki/Zoning)
hqh9bs5 : A small but positive benefit is increasing services, such as jobs, transport and even outside connections.
hqkf4ms : Build more commercial and industrial. Sims demand jobs on your cities so put more. Once their demand is fulfilled they'll demand more residential zones for Sims to employ
hqfdk2i : This is correct. A way to verify what r/Steel_Ratt is saying, is to cease 5 industries simultaneously. If you have industries dlc. 

Another way to test this is to spam services. These create jobs.

Or, like, tree distancing or whatevs
hqgvyml : AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
hqi3mop : Wildfires are no joke in this game. I had ones like this before and was like "lol, a lone tree". Looked back a few minutes later and a whole neighborhood was up and I didn't have the firefighter infrastructure to deal, so the whole city basically went and I had to start a new game. Sad time.
hqjjezg : GUYS ITS OK! HES STARTED RECYCLING!
hqkwnn9 : Yes, but in this case the other trees far enough to doesn't caught fire, that was the only tree which burned down in the fire. Also funny thing that, the game alarmed because it's a natural disaster fire, but when a tree in a custom made park caught fire and half of the city burning down, nobody cares :D
hql49n1 : Wait so the game doesn't alarm for park fires? I didn't know. You got a lucky escape. Maybe you should make a memorial statue there or park to commemorate the Great Fire of December 2021.
hqonyv1 : I mean if you custom plop trees to make a park, and these trees caught fire, the game didn't notice you. Only if the forest fire triggered as a natural disaster event (like earthquake or tsunami).

hqfjjkk : - Theme Mixer 2 - mix some good themes like Laviante, Temperate Coast, Abu Simbal... Also adjust exposure and Rayleigh Scattered after apply LUT to desire brightness and shadow deepness. Dont forget to save a preset or you will lost the setting after reboot. This mod pretty much does most of the visual heavy lifting, dont need to mess with much else

- LUT - Clerya and Laviante are good

- Cubemap Replacer to change sky texture. It require several other visual mods to functions but you dont need to tweak anything about them.

- Dynamic Resolution, pump up render resolution for better and smoother visual, less aliasing

- Ultimate Level of Detail - crank draw distance, kill your PC, burn your house... 

- other extra post process : Sharper Texture, Shadow Strength Adjuster, Ultimate Eyecandy,  ReShade (external tool), etc...

Yes the vanilla game is quite ugly, the vanilla building assets also make it worst... The game was originally made with very cartooney visual style, and the dev really regretted it later - evidently the assets on later DLCs are much much more realistic and better quality. Much like other modding games like Skyrim, Fallout, the base game was quite ugly... you need to throw a visual mods and high quality assets on it to make them looks better...

[random screenshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/rrdj7l/random_neighbourhood/)
hqfhjph : You’re missing mods. The game does actually look like crap, it’s from 2015 and it was never designed to be beautiful. Almost all PC players are using a wide array of mods to make the game into something a lot different from what the actual devs released 6 years ago, and that includes a bunch of mods for visually enhancing the game.

It’s a lot to explain in one Reddit comment, but Google how to make cities skylines look realistic or something like that and watch some videos or read up on what comes up. You need Relight, a LUT of your choosing, Ultimate Eyecandy, Dynamic Resolution and a handful of other mods to get the game to actually look nice.
hqflj3y : I lot of what you see published is going to be spruced up by mods, but I wouldn't say that it is necessary. You see plenty of screenshots from console games which can't have mods and I'm sure a lot of people play un-modded.

Posting a screenshot of the type of visual problems you are experiencing would go a long way towards identifying whether or not that is 'normal' and whether mods will help you.
hqgbl2y : Stock antialiasing is crap imo, makes game look like 720p
hqfwcfw : Thank you for those suggestions. I feel excited to try them out after my rant earlier in hope of some resolve Appreciate the time you took to list them mate.
hqim10j : I got the game looking okay now with these suggestions. The aliasing is still terrible but it looks a little better with some SMAA. 

Now I can finally see if I like the game
hqfi4tx : Thanks a lot. I am reinstalling now to try and get rid of the visual pop ins, I know those are probably due to a corrupt file somewhere as it is too pronounced to be intended and I don't remember having this issue years ago.  

I will try those mods. I really want to enjoy this game and it pains me to not be able to look at it without the discomfort to my eyes. Appreciate the comment.
hqit4h8 : > The aliasing

hit F10 > crank to 4K++ resolution with Dynamic Resolution, that's the only proper way. Post process AA will never yield satisfactory result.

ULOD also require manual adjustment in the option menu, it don't just crank to over90000000 by default.

on weaker machine it is best to just leave them default when playing normally, only raise them up when taking picture / video. But if your hardware can handle the extra load, then sure, go ahead and leave them at very high adjustmnets.
hqfk3tz : No problem, hope you can get it looking to your liking.

I would need to see a screenshot of the visual pop ins you’re referring to as I can’t really envision what you’re describing so if you can post a screenshot maybe myself or someone else can help you fix that as well.
hqitc0s : Oh right, I had it at +500% (GTX 1070) setting in options. Did not know there was an F10 interface. Will have a look after work.
hqflsbf : Yeah its terrible, for instance the initial highway offramp. If I zoom in and out or rotate it just dissapears and reapears when panning or zooming, as well as trees, rocks etc. Every asset on the initial map. 

And it constantly pops in and out. I will have to see if the reinstall fixes this issue, I know it is not by design, but the game being smudged is, and so I will try to improve it with some mods. 

I thought everyone just plays vanilla, these beautiful screenshots are with visual enhancements, they must be.
hqigiix : The pop ins are fixed after reinstall. I have had this game installed for years and years and something got corrupted. 

I have done a few graphical mods too, and things are looking a bit better. Aliasing is still horrendous, The dynamic resolution mod does not seem to be doing much for me, but I will embark on the modding adventure now and see where it takes me.
hqfu8wm : Ultimate level of detail (ULOD) mod and the others recommended on that mod's description page might be your solution.

Another thing might be the global driver settings for your GPU, some things that work well for other games could be doing weird things in skylines.  Even more obscure is if your motherboard is even communicating with the GPU at full speed.
hqirj9y : You need to crank up dynamic resolution above 100%, it does nothing by default/set at 100%. Hit F10 to access its interface.
hqfvutf : Thanks. If the bug persists after reinstall I will try the ULOD.

Don't think it is a hardware issue. I am familiar with PC hardware and this has persisted on my previous machine and prior 1080P monitor. I have no issues with any other games. I have reinstalled drivers and set to default profiles. 

Maybe it's my eyes? Honestly I am starting to think that it is astigmatism, but I don't struggle to see other games.

hqfgrad : Honestly if you’ve been playing the game for years without DLC’s do yourself the favor and self love and get on them. Huge difference in game play when you have the DLC’s. Personally I don’t use trams as much as I’m more of a metro train kind of guy. But I have the DLC and if you’re saying it’s on sale and you have been contemplating to get it, just do it.
hqfnlu0 : The DLC's go on sale pretty often, I always snatch them up at -50%. Definitely worth it!
hqfm2n1 : Trams are the single most commonly mentioned favourite/interesting Snowfall feature by respondents to our “Best DLC” survey: https://new.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/wiki/bestdlc#wiki_snowfall
hqfwfan : Yes it definitely is.
Trams are great. You like them in real life, you will like them in skylines. They just look cool and have a good capacity for transit, especially the modded ones. And cims love them, too. I could base my entite cities transit on trams cause with a bit planning, they are were frequently taken.

And with snowfall you'll get cool winter looks, maybe you'll enjoy that in the future.
hqftju0 : Yes.  Yes it is.  If you’re in no rush, try to buy it when it’s on sale, which games have sales on Steam fairly often.
hqfgkya : I did that. Trams are fun :)
hqg60rd : Everybody who bought Snowfall did it for the trams. Is it worth it? Probably not, but I like Trams and thats the only way to get them.
hqg6b21 : I did and no regrets. I love me some trams
hqgqtpd : Hey OP, gimme your steam name via PM and what DLC you don't have.
hqgwg1z : I really do like the trams and integrating all of the different public transport types. A little annoying that the seasons don’t change on the snow maps.
hqgymty : It adds that Eastern European "I've got to hide before Agent 47 finds me" vibe to a city that I enjoy. The trams I mean, not the snow.
hqi2v30 : I love the trams. Literal game changer for me. Streets get way less congested if you plan it out right.
hqfirws : Objectively speaking, no. However having trams and making routes for them is very fun. I'd say it's one of those purchases that might not be a great bang for your buck, but is totally worth it for your enjoyment :)
hqg9fys : Probably not but I did it anyway.

Why? Because I live in a tram city and I love trams
hqgjxox : I think whether it is worth it depends on the person.  I bought Snowfall just for trams, I've had it a few years and I've still never done a snow map.  Feels worth it to me but I'm a transit geek who thinks trams are cool.

> but I love trams in real life

So for you I would say it's worth it.  Seems like you know what you are getting into.
hqh5bhw : I have all the DLC except the music packs. This way I can build my way.
hqhcl48 : I played for about a year before buying dlcs. Best decision ever
hqfnfjw : Just for the trams? No. But I will say that next to metro, trams are the most used public transit in my builds. And if it’s on sale, even better. You’ll get a lot of use out of them so I’d say buy it!
hqh4px9 : Trams are awesome.  If the price seems too much, think of it as a tip jar for the devs.

I already buy the DLC on sale usually so the price isn't an issue for me.
hqfgse2 : [deleted]
hqflpuz : [removed]
hqfyx8h : If it’s on sale (and it is rn) then I’d say definitely. Imo trams are indispensable for public transit in the game, unless you’re modding transit vehicle capacity. They’re available early, and little more expensive than buses but better in every way. They have a really wide service range that they’re still useful in — I’ve got lines running from 30% to 200% capacity — and make a very strong backbone for your system.
hqg5cl9 : Get it on sale. It’s worth it if you’ve played for years
hqg7phe : Snowfall is worth it on its own IF you already have all the quality DLCs. The maps are fun enough and there's a lot of cool stuff like heating, road maintenance, and spas that work on other maps. The only downside is that it gets so boring looking at nothing but snow on those maps, they really should have tried to do some kind of seasons thing. Snowfall isn't worthless, it's just meh.
hqg88cz : The DLC are cheap. Go for it. The winter mechanic I also personally enjoy
hqgicvo : Get the dlc! If you love the game then treat yourself and get it! Don’t think about the money, if you like it then you have to get it! Honestly if you’ve played the game for that long then you simply have to get some dlc! You’ve milked out all the content you can, now get an upgrade since you’ve enjoyed the game for so long, seriously mate, you deserve it!
hqgm7cn : Yes, imo. Trams are great
hqgnje1 : Yes it is
hqgpfye : I did exactly that, got the the dlc for the trams and I think it’s worth it.  Trams just make your city look so lively. Also easy to integrate into existing networks and pretty good capacity. Personaly after dark and industries are by far my favorite dlc.
hqgs9fy : Hell yeah
hqh12c7 : Trams are so worth it tbh. I got Snowfall just for the trams but then recently started a snow city and that adds some new fun dynamics to the game too, and some awesome snow assets as well!
hqh27xt : the whole organization of DLC features is such a cash grab.  
there should be a transportation dlc with all the transportation related things [including bikes] instead of having to buy 8 different ones.
hqhaxtv : The DLC's are so cool im ngl
hqhfrmt : Imo the only DLC I can't recommend is the Sunset Harbor one.
hqhfst3 : Yes, totally. The snow is fun too but the teams are what it's about.
hqhiw86 : Honestly, has anyone bought the DLC for anything other than trams?
hqhl0wp : Yes
hqhl8dr : if you are big into public transit, then heck yea. Whenever i need a niche between trains and buses in the inner city, trams are the go to. Heck, i damn near use trams more than buses period because of their utility. Plus they look damn good around the city. Gives the space life
hqhlwoc : Oh yeah, trans are great! There’s also scads of mods to change them up
hqhny4s : I found this game at the beginning of the pandemic and played for months before buying the dlc. Wish I would have just bought them from the get go. They make the game 100x more immersive.
hqholjy : As much as I would've loved that Mass Transit's Cable Cars were swapped for Snowfall's Trams, I'd say treat yourself good and get the DLC. It's [on sale on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/420610/Cities_Skylines__Snowfall/) right now for 50% off
hqhowk6 : I like Snowfall's added challenge from having to account for heating your city (you don't need dedicated heating plants or pipes, but you can end up with significant electrical fluctuations if your citizens are just relying on your power plant to heat their homes).   I hardly ever play on winter maps (some of the achievements and bonus goals, especially one involving a snow dump, just about drove me up the wall before I completed them) and don't really use the trams much, but both look really neat.

To explain "winter maps," it can't snow on every map, only ones that are marked as Winter.  If you're expecting something like The Sims 3: Seasons, imagine what that would have been like if it could only snow in three neighborhoods.  I do think Snowfall was worth it (I got it for a very low price, like $4 or $5, and that's how much I'd pay), but I think in some cases it could have done a better job of interacting with other packs (Natural Disasters didn't give me significant blizzards or avalanches, Green Cities' eco-skyscrapers that grow plants on the side of the buildings don't really accumulate much snow on the sides during snowstorms, and I think the trams would have been better suited for Mass Transit but were most of the reason I bought Snowfall to begin with).
hqhpp58 : Trams completely replaced metros for me and dramatically decreased my bus usage.
hqhtfrv : Aren’t trams in some mods, I’ve using them for over a year and still don’t have snowfall
hqhxn1d : Get them all especially mass transit because it adds so many new transportation options and if you haven’t had any of the dlc then I go for it
hqhz7ib : From a purely gameplay standpoint, I’d say not really. The monorail in Mass Transit and Trolleybuses in Sunset Harbor both fill similar niches, and both those expansions are generally better than Snowfall. 

If you’re considering the eyecandy factor, trams are great, I love them. It was worth it to me to get Snowfall on sale.
hqi9of4 : Imo yes. I think trams look really good in cities and they're an easy to implement transport option with decent passenger capacity
hqialra : I've been considering this as well and based on the comments I am sold
hqichvn : While the Steam Sale is on? Why not.
hqijsro : It depends. Are you short on money? Yes? Then buy food. No? Buy it, Trams are dope
hqimxas : I recently got the mayor's edition bundle 75% off on Xbox, included snowfall, Green cities, mass transit and I think natural disasters along with some radio packs and content creator packs. You should snatch one of those if it's on offer!
hqiomkc : As a CIM player, I wouldn't have even played the game without snowfall. I bought the game back at launch as was disappointed with it and went back to playing CIM2 doing some transit mega builds. I feel like only recently has CS grown enough to do what cim could do, I wouldn't even have it installed without Snowfall. I'm not even interested in the winter maps as much as I love the features they add, because they don't goto summer.(WHY?!?!? yeah, I kinda understand the technical reasons, but it feels lazy., I would PAY for a snowfall 2 that added real seasons to all the maps, and added the department of transportation road maintenance/snow plow gameplay enhancements. They really need to fix this, someway though I think so ppl will stop complaining about it and can actually like the DLC
hqir2lw : Didn't know trams were exclusive to thar, I absolutely love them.
hqit23o : Frozenshire is a beautiful snow map, which is also worth it.
hqivhjm : I actually got the snowfall DLC just for the trams and I al happy with that. Every time Steam comes up with sales I buy 1 or 2 DLCs. It's worth the €4. Now I just bought the mass transit DLC and I wonder if I would ever actually use monorails or blimps since I find metro's so much more space-efficient.
hqiwdho : Yes. A million times yes.

Myself being a railway fiend, my cities relies heavily on trams system for in-city transit, trains for outside connection, buses as collection between the two networks.

For i don't know how reliable the 78% being, so far traffic seems to be the least of my problems
hqiycr3 : I am in same situation, deciding buy or not because only the trams interesting. thank you for your post.
hqiyl86 : It's depending of what you want to do.
For me, trams is a great extension, I use tram to replace Bus for a faster acces to metro (best public transport).

With mods, residential zones in my map have a very low car traffic, people use tram + metro to go on commercial and industrial zone.
hqiz2kx : As someone who got after dark just for the bike lanes, yes
hqj2dv8 : What annoys me about trams is that I am not able to build underground tram stops and I’m not really able to separate the 4 lane avenue tram track from car traffic at intersections. I would love to build a light rail system like in Los Angeles but it is impossible. You can only use trams as “bigger buses” as they carry more people, so I haven’t bought it myself
hqj54ve : Definitely worth if you play the game a lot and they are usually on sale
hqj9z7p : It's just a few bux so why not?
hqjbwv2 : Just the reason I've got it back when it was out. Definitely worth it if you're into trams, especially at a discount.
hqjcl3g : You can get most of the DLCs on cdkeys for just a few quid so I would say it's deffo worth it!
hqjdmsf : SAUNA
hqjiwss : If you buy the dlc does it snow on all maps or just the ones that come with the dlc?
hqjkk3c : I did and I do not regret it. They are by far my most used public transport and if you are on PC, there's a ton of fantastic tram models on the workshop and road options a plenty...especially Clus...that dude has made some unbelievably amazing tram roads.
hqjld7e : just bought it for 5$ to try the game again (and it's still an endless game i play sporadically otherwise i'd have no life).

very expensive to run trams, actually all types of traffic is losing money for me in a profitable city.

it's good that you can change road blocks to include the tram tracks, like in Transport Fever.

when it's snowing, it's cute but it's difficult to see the city.

i'd say it's required to have one of the most popular DLCs \[Mass Transit, After Dark, Snowfall\] to be able to avoid the traffic jams. That's the main benefit. Doesn't matter which one.
hqk0xau : yes, get it, they are AWESOME. i use them everywhere
hqk45vz : Trams are arguably the most useful and satisfying form of public transport in the game. The look cool, sound cool, and are extremely functional and versatile.
hqkiacs : I tend to run my cities with three modes of public transport at a time and I think since getting Snowfall, trams have always been in one of the three I use in a city so I'd say yes.
hqfje5z : The snowfall DLC is worth it for the snow
hqgscxr : I'm playing this game on ps4 and i bought all DLC on sale. I have so much stuff. So much fun. It waas worth
hqg51c9 : 100% agree
hqh66f9 : You can sometimes get them better than 50% on the grey market. CD keys websites. I guess that comes at risk but I've never had a problem.

Kinda frustrating that the official store never seems to dip below 50% off.

hqix25b : ~~CDKEYS~~ piracy, those keys apparently hurt the developers even more, if you're never going to buy them at full price, \*one\* of those are not going to harm sales. If you can afford to pay, **PAY.**
hqfwm2p : No, snowfall dlc also comes with snowfall. Winter cities can look nice too.
hqfw70p : You sound like a person who's never played on a winter map.

hqgji9r : Oh
hqiz5d5 : They're a corporation, they can handle it when the game has a total dlc count that costs hundreds of dollars. Its not like Paradox are an indie studio, or one person or anything like that. I shamelessly use creamapi, I can't imagine enjoying the game as much as I do without the content but fuck me if I'll fork over more than 50 bucks for game dlc. A pirates life for me it is.
hqgx9hq : You know what? I actually haven't! I got snowfall for trams and only trams.
hqfxavc : meh. i dont even play with the sun going down anymore. it takes 20 minutes to the load the game, i dont have time for that.
hqjcrws : I avoid key reselling sites because regardless of if you support developers or not sometimes the sellers use fraudulent or stolen credit cards to make a profit.

And they don't care if they're doing this to a small indie studio or a giant corporation.
hqj4o50 : They have employees that need to get payed
hqh77wc : Me too, trams are life.
hqigqmk : Same here, recently bought that dlc for trams but haven't yet added any trams yet, waiting to add them to my new low density residential area soon.
hqg6kya : Best thing for loading times is to upgrade to solid state drives
hqfzrxt : Neither do I, but I at least try to know what's included in each DLC ;)
hqlp64e : You think they aren't making fucktons of money? They're a huge game dev team for one of the most popular pc games. They can handle it. Besides I bought the damn base game, they have my dollars.
hqh7sny : I've never seen one IRL so it's the only way I can get a tram fix
hqg7o1z : yes. i think i was doing 30 minute loads before i did that. when i switched to an SSD it cut it down to 10-15 min i think. now we're back up to 20. haha. unfortunaltey i think my motherboard has a limit of 64GB of ram for some reason.
hqjdn9v : This... after I binged a bunch of mods and models I then had to figure out which one broke my savegame.  Perfect time to uninstall and reinstall onto a ssd and it loads blistering fast now.
hqg48r6 : the only reason i even got it was trams, and i waited until it was deeply on sale at that.
hqiuprf : It appears to work great in Budapest, Hungary as well as San Francisco, America.

Denmark has implemented a tram line, which is currently in test drive. There have been a few collisions with pedestrians and cars.
Going back in history our capital Copenhagen had a lot of trams.

I like the nostalgic feeing you get from the trams.
hqg8yxs : How big is your city? I can only imagine the gameplay if load times are 20 mins…
hqimpob : My game took 3 minutes to load, and I'm sitting here going, 'why is this so slow'. I've spoiled myself.
hqix494 : I'm in Melbourne and I took a photo of a derailed tram :P
hqjkuzd : Aarhus has an operational tram line for a few years now.

But I am excited to see the one in Odense.
hqgd2hz : like 36K, but it takes that long on a fresh map too. i swear it took sim city 4 like an hour to load for me back in the day. it always hangs up on loading one part of the game, i forget which one it shows on the loading screen mod.
hqixe97 : I guess the reason for the derailment is to be found in r/idiotsincars. 🤔
On a “positive note” I would rather derail in a tram than in a train or metro.
hqge3wf : Yeah, you might have something else going on if that's the case. Factory reset is always a good option, if nothing else helps.
hqgsd0w : You 100% have some issues
hqgukhi : There is no way that difference is solely SSD vs HDD unless that HDD is also dying or something

You might want to do some investigatory work on your rig
hqhfxij : unless you are using every single mod in the workshop it makes 0 sense that you have loadtimes like that with a "smaller" city...
hqkohio : I run a potato with my 8GB RAM maxed out (only 1GB video too...) and I still load quicker than that. You've definitely got an issue somewhere. With no mods/assets you should be loading in a minute or so I would have thought.
hqhyc1q : Plot Twist: He has a Pentium 3
hqj9z3x : with the workshop,... yes.
hqkq7qg : no issues. just workshop.

hqfk0sh : Biggest roundabout in my city (so far) so decided to build a park in it... Since there's no street-level crossing to get to the island in the roundabout, what better way to do that with an overhead bridge...

But that looked too simple so went and did a radial pedestrian network and linked it up with the high school, some residential blocks, shopping area, offices and the tram station nearby

Lots of pedestrians using the network... And thankfully vehicles seem to use all lanes of the roundabout
hqfqk14 : How did you get the elevated network looking that good especially at the intersections? Awesome job!!
hqfriah : Use node controller to increase 'corner offset' to make the intersections wider/more smooth. Also make intersections along slopes sloped instead of just flat. Hope this helps :)

hqfndys : Nice build! Japan style?
hqg4eqv : Very nice. Good use of space.
hqh58w1 : i need a better pc so i can have sick cities like this, like i can have mods but assets set it on fire
hqgd1p1 : What's that station asset?
hqh8v4c : I really enjoyed this picture of a random neighbourhood. Overall it looks cool, I like the abundance of colour, and the layout is great!
hqhput9 : What house assets are those?
hqibdw7 : Great build! I’m looking into a similar build. Do you have an asset list you could share? I’m guessing you plopped everything?
hqfpwlc : Thx. More like just Frankenstein Asia style,

I not gonna say I understood Japanese cities since I wasn't their resident ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ It just so happens Japanese Assets are pretty much the dominant Asian assets so... yeah.
hqhag1k : custom, made out of stuff like [this roof](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2105375780&searchtext=station+roof) and [this pedestrian bridge](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2691007659&searchtext=pedestrian+bridge)

there's a very specific thing needed to be done when making functional custom station, [watch this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgdmeBEzXGw) if needed.
hqhqff5 : JPEH - Japanese Easy House
hqingx6 : You can follow the following authors who prominently make Japanese assets: KonnoModel, TOKACHI269, koma, Ryuichi Kaminogi, curr66, YODOH.

Yes, had to plop everything, it's faster to plop with RICO than to grow tbh, sometime grid also don't behave the way you want it to behave so it just completely wasting time trying to deal with them.

Since I just uses JPEH - Japanese Easy House asset, plopping house is a billion time easier & faster than using those undecorated ones.

hqfo377 : No. Much like in real life, you don't haul heavy soil hundreds of kilometres to where you want it, you usually acquire it on site, or nearby, be it by demolishing a hill or deepening a river or other channel. But I'm pretty sure you can turn on unlimited soil in the content manager in the main menu.
hqftrga : IIRC, there is an official / included mod called 'Unlimited Soil' that will do this. I'm pretty sure that this is available on console (along with 'Unlimited Money' and 'Unlimited Ore and Oil').
hqfqdph : Thanks 👍
hqfxyok : Yea it is but i wanna get achievements on this playthrough
hqg0gpb : Then you're outta luck, sorry.
hqg8lfg : Np ill figure something out, thanks for responding 👍
hqg9xu9 : If you’re on a coastal map you can try and dredge soil from out in the ocean 

Be carful not to do it on pause tho or you’ll likely cause a tsunami
hqgbq9o : Yea i am, thanks ill try it out!
hqgc8tg : I’ll just repeat this,   **watch out for tsunamis**

Terraforming in or near water will frequently throw the water physics into chaos and flood your city.   

Save before you try this ... just incase
hqgcl75 : I will!
hqho73i : It’s been 5 hours.    Curious how many sims died in the tsunami flood ? Lol

hqgftfb : Spaghetti, because you felt like it.
hqg08db : I feel some connections are a bit overkill with that roundabout below serving many exists, but then I see many buses and trucks using those "overkill exits" and yeah...you know your city lol
hqfylx1 : How long did that take you?
hqglp9i : When system interchanges have babies with service junctions!
hqhkwv2 : r/shittyskylines
hqgi2nw : I like that overpass road that goes through the middle of the circle. Its functional, and I bet it looks cool from a top down view

Edit: it does lol
hqiaatn : I had a similarly funny spot to deal with, mine isn't so much an interchange of roads, but a way to bypas the highway and connections direct from the industry area (topleft) to the dense commercial district (right). The elevated highway segment coming from the top is one-way, as is the one going towards the right, so the connections are mostly ways off of one, and ways on the other. https://i.imgur.com/jtoICyB.png
hqh1dy6 : It's cool! I like it! I guess you worked out these are the routes your Cims want to take. I have to warn you tho, when you start expanding, this solution might not be sufficient anymore. But I love your creativity and patience (everyone who can build Vanilla deserves praise).

If that happens, might I suggest charting which routes go where, and finding a real life interchange that has similar connections, and see if you can recreate that? That's what really helped me hone in on the requirements for good traffic flow.
hqhnmfz : Average American city be like

hqhvxnf : Spaghetti AND a giant meatball.
hqidvrs : Spaghetti.
hqgl83a : The squid strikes again! That being said, if it works, hell yeah! \\o/
hqgm60q : Of course I know him, he’s me.
hqiuq7n : I have to agree ! There was a classic Industrial area before the touristic one you can see in the top left of the 2nd picture so it was a bit more scaled. Looking at it, I hesitate re-scaling as it might be useful for the future :)
hqkgja1 : Op didn’t ask for advice
hqfzbff : I did not count but I guess somewhere between 2 and 5 hours.
hqiv9ax : That's what I love in this game, trying to guess which should be the best solution and to apply. Only the second time I rebuild this one :D

hqgm94u : Time really flies when you get involved in a project in the game. I’m impressed.

hqggr2t : You could build a marina.  Terraform the land into a C or U shape, feather it out, add some nice roads, a handful of piers inside, add sunset harbor fishing asset to get boats moving around in it, place parklife assets like fishing and water gazebos, add restaurant piers, etc.
hqg3o0x : I am partial to city park. It can be a nice touch to the business district nearby and make the district more 'natural'
hqgk4n8 : Just leave some nature, going to the beach is always nice :)
hqh8ueo : If it’s on a river, build two dams. Then drain the whole thing for super high risk development 😝
hqg7svd : B
hqgcnpw : I would do a mix of A and B 
Most of it can be dedicated to piers and park but you could have a section of reclaimed land with just an amusement park
hqgljzd : B with C - a park with more focus on nature but having piers and small entertainment spots could be nice.
hqhnj19 : Off topic, but which map is this
hqgfq9l : A, because I feel like it
hqgq42h : I like A, I put a zoo on the coast surrounded by high density it looks really good I think.
hqgu48d : I say a tourism district with some commercial and some parks, maybe even a harbor. This will require some terraforming.
hqhj2ab : Promenade & recreation area that’s a functioning park area 👌🏼
hqhoacd : I like option B, if it was a more tourist-focused area I would vote A, but this looks like your CBD, where normal cims are living and working, so option B makes the most sense to me there.
hqih1gv : google earth coastal cities,u can get ideas
hqkdyj2 : You can go with A. It fits probably in my opinion, you can extend the coast making like a bulge then add in your amusement so it looks like a pier carnival. I preferably suggest B. It's great, also fits on a coastal area, but whatever fits on your mind :)

hqg5481 : That just means you don't have enough memory.
hqg54fl : You're using way more assets than the computer can handle, it looks like. Not enough RAM.
hqg66rm : I would suggest trying to reduce your asset collection. Are you really going to use that amount of asset in your city? I have around 200 assets and all the dlcs and I still don’t use them all. To help reduce your ram usage I would read how to skip prefabs to stop the game loading any vanilla assets you don’t ever use. Such as props and buildings. Look at your dlcs as well are there some ccp/dlc that you hardly ever use?
===============
rrghaz
hqg873s : The most important thing for late-game performance is single-threaded CPU performance. If you want to run all DLC and lots of custom assets, you'll need a bunch of RAM (16GB minimum, preferably 32GB). A mid-weight GPU (late 10- or low 20- series nvidia) will be fine unless you want to start getting into high levels of detail with dynamic resolution and YouTuber-quality level of detail settings.

hqg5l5l : I’m guessing death wave. If your not using a mod to mix up your population such as life cycle rebalance expect death waves. The game starts cims off at the same age roughly when they migrate to your city same for the cims children. So if you mass develop residential in a short time they will all start dying around the same time. Build small residential zones and let time pass a bit before zoning more this should help reduce the death wave and make it easy to manage.
hqg9p9n : [here is a recent post on same topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/rqlnym/my_city_has_been_having_these_huge_death_waves/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) - worth looking it over as well
hqg4wrd : Death wave?
hqg7zzo : If you zoned the areas in question all at once and on pause, that’s why they are dying at the same time. Make sure you have elder and death care facilities as well as zoning one block or house at a time while the game is running. That will minimize synchronized death.
hqgctn2 : Still over zoning I see
hqgmhwc : Hey boss, you know there's a pandemic going around right? Have you not gotten any federal aid yet?
hqgwrom : If you zone residential in large batches and people come in waves, this is normal. It's just growing pains! :)
hqg6wk8 : Agree with this, but even with life cycle rebalance, I find I can still get deathwaves if my traffic is bad and ambulances can’t get places fast enough.  Feel like the whole game comes back to traffic most of the time.
hqgadrv : [deleted]
hqh400l : Not at all. I only did one or two blocks every 30 minutes or so.
hqghn5g : Ouch. I used to do that until now.
hqh6uyb : Well if it’s none of the above you listed, it’s a death wave and there’s only one way to create a death wave and is the opposite of what you claim. 

So do you want help or are you just gonna keep spamming this thread with nonsense

hqg69zs : I could not imagine the pain of having to manage a city under crisis with a controller. I couldn't even imagine managing a city with a controller. PC is going to be a leagues better experience for this game
hqg8k93 : I actually played on console for a year before I got a gaming pc. It’s an entirely different game on pc. Not only is a mouse and keyboard 1000x better for building the thousands of mods you have access to make the game better in pretty much every conceivable way.

Some of the biggest mods are basically full on patches to the base game that make things so much better in ways that should’ve already been there.

And then there’s visuals. The base game itself renders much better on PC but on top of that there is custom assets for literally anything you could possibly think of. It’s how people post cities on here that almost look real.
hqg7bw3 : PC games usually are better on PC. i cant imagine the headache of making a curved road.
hqg5nkx : Yes, it is better in every conceivable way.
hqh3w43 : Only if your computer is capable of running it smoothly. I tried it once on my laptop (probably 10 years old at this point) & it was an unpleasant experience to put it mildly, 35 minutes to load a fresh empty map.

I'll eventually move to PC once I get a capable laptop, Until then, Xbox it is.
hqg6a22 : Besides mods?  Absolutely.  I can’t imagine trying to lay out a city with a controller.  Having a mouse just makes details easier to control, in my opinion.  I’m seen some good console cities and I give you guys some serious credit for that.  But it’s 1000% times better with mods and a mouse.
hqg9fdz : A lot of hate going on about playing with a controller but I honestly don’t find it that bad.   It was awkward getting used to when I switched from pc to console but they did a really good job at laying out the controller functions and console UI to be fairly easy to navigate and use and are fairly intuitive to learn.   Sure at times you gotta spend a few extra seconds finessing something into place or panning camera to get it to fit right but it’s not that cumbersome really IMO. 

That said, console version has M&K support so you can always plug those into the console and ditch the controller
hqgl43l : Can't tell you more than others have said regarding ease of play - bottom line is, it could improve gameplay but if you have a functioning way of playing with  once-over you may not feel much difference.

Re: Mods. 
It's so worth it. Mods open so many doors, makes a lot of things more realistic and less frustrating to deal with. Not only the practicality and time you can save by using certain Mods, you also have  so many brilliant assets and props that expand gameplay and replayability.

I'd definitely consider getting a PC version provided you have the bare minimum specs to run it.
hqhbh9c : Honestly, I don't know how you console players do it. This is one of those games that practically demands mouse and keyboard. Plus we have more of the expansions on PC I think. Definitely worth it.
hqjorjg : It depends on what you’re looking for! I think the PS4 version of the game is extremely good and I’ve been using that for a long time before deciding to move on to PC myself. If you like more casual, vanilla play and don’t care about micromanaging the looks or other aspects of your city, I don’t see a reason to switch to PC 

(besides the controls being a bit more fluid and there being less bugs (not sure if that’s actually true, but it feels like the PS4 version has more bugs to me)). 

With that being said, if you’re looking to expand and try new things by experimenting with mods or go into more detail with your city and have a lot more control over what you’re doing, you should absolutely play the PC version. 
The workshop and the modding community are the heart of Cities Skylines and it wouldn’t nearly be as enjoyed by people as it is now without it. 
Playing with mods however can be a lot more stressful and overwhelming, so if you decide to go for the PC version I’d recommend easing into that. Plus if you’re a perfectionist like me it will take you ages to get anything done :p. 

So yeah if you’re interested in switching to the PC version, CS is usually pretty cheap so go for it and decide from there :)
hqge1hc : It's pretty much the same.
hqgmd75 : Personally, and this is from a life long gamer, console is cool, but PC is where it's at. 

The multitude of hot keys, tools, quick navigation via a mouse and much more responsive zooming/etc. I feel that because of my use of computers, the game was made a lot more intuitive for me, and because it translated well from previous PC games like SimCity3000. 

I like console, but with these games PC is just my gold standard
hqgog59 : It's why I built a computer last year, well not the only reason.
hqgokor : Depends on your PC, mods are amazing and all but if it can't perform then stick with console. Maybe get it on sale for real cheap and see how it does.
hqhv2ud : I have been playing on Xbox for a year and just switched to PC. Its a completely differently experience for me and I enjoy playing it qay more now since I'm not limited.
hqqbz1h : Thank you all for the posts! I will get city skylines on PC for a new year's gift!
hqge4uv : Console supports m&k...
hqgw4ol : What are some must-have mods? Just started playing.
hqhbov9 : We're you using the loading screen mod?  I would be very surprised if you had 35 min loading times using it. If you do go back to pc make sure that's the first mod you subscribe to.
hqir3mh : I totally agree. As long as you have patience then a controller is totally fine. I actually play with the touchscreen controls on PS4 remoteplay so I just play CS on my tablet. 

I know that a keyboard and mouse is better, but I can't walk around my apartment or lay on the couch while playing on my computer. It's sort of like how a Nintendo Switch has awful ergonomics and a tiny low res screen, but it can still be a desirable platform for some situations.
hqgfhpm : Console don't support the steam workshop tho lol
hqhcu89 : If you have access to the Steam Workshop under the Mod tag, sort by “most popular” and over time period “all time”.  Almost every mod listed on the first page is extremely helpful. Read each description so you know what you are getting (some mod functions are duplicated within other mods).  After that it is really up to your style of play.  I would recommend activating only one or two mods at a time to make it easier to learn how to use each one.
hqhgtwp : No, I just started the game for the first time. No mods, no dlcs. It was my laptop most likely, the thing sounded like a jet engine ready to take off.

Thanks! I heard about that mod, it'll definitely be the first one I install when I eventually upgrade.
hqgfq78 : >besides the mods

I don't think anybody said it did lol
hqhnzr1 : Yep, can stress enough how important it is that in the start people need to start with a few mods, not to take the full pack, as it is a completely different game once you mod it enough... I was overwhelmed in the beginning and it was 2016! Now i can't imagine how i would play with 100+ gameplay mods that I'd have to learn from scratch together with the game itself
hqhooa5 : Loading screen mod, less steam and fps booster fixed the game for me on my 6 year old laptop, but any older than that and i wonder if the hardware is even supported
hqhq9bp : Yep, software can only help old hardware so much. At point a new hardware is necessary.

hqgyhab : They sippin' on the poo water
hqgjpda : Did you have a death wave? That's a lot of ambulances, jesus
hqh8k06 : Did you move people in too quickly? or was it the dirty water issue? because they can be rookie mistakes lol
hqj6qg4 : Lol
hqgmb5j : To be a death wave it had to be hearses, probably a contamination but then the hearses would come xD
Good luck OP
hqh8tdu : also intelligent citizens are less likely to get ill or die, sounds stupid but is true. Try seeing if your education levels are good or your citizens well being (happiness)
hqhe9f2 : >intelligent citizens are less likely to get ill or die, sounds stupid but is true.

I mean...it apparently takes a certain level of intellectualism to not go around licking doorknobs.
hqhiwoo : yeah i mean you’re not wrong
hqhlmjy : I’ll be over in the corner muttering about mask usage and vaccine rates…
hqhm2o6 : it’s okay the education system failed a majority of people around the world
===============
rri5fe
hqh2kdn : I wanted to check -- what exactly do you mean when you say "I got the avenues". You should have all the roads you need in the base game. If your bus stop is appearing in the middle of the street, that sounds like a tram stop. Bus stops should be at the "sidewalk" side of the road.

You might want to try making your bus route with vanilla buses first, just to make sure it works. Then add one custom piece at a time....
hqh43kz : Really don't understand the question, but I imagine that the enhanced stop select mod (name is something similar) should help
hqh415l : I already tried everything at this point. I see some players having their brt working fine but mine just doesn't. See BRT roads on steam, they have multiple lanes with 2 bus lanes in the middle.
BRT irl is a tram but bus...
hqh813z : In a simple way, people are pulling it off and I am not,
I also tried that, no luck
===============
rri9q4
hqgjjyx : As long all parts of your city are connected to a power source (house yo house, house to turbine) then it should work.
hqgmkqz : I suggest you doing do and also if you want to play it vanilla, I reccomend putting 2 power lines so in case one pole gets destroyed u have a 2nd supply. 
I started doing this and my city stopped having those shutdowns
hqggrb5 : I group them together if the land is suitable for it
hqgvjok : I've found that building->building power connections have a limited range, but power lines have an unlimited range (I haven't used any *really* long power lines though).
hqh6ucw : Never seen that before, unless there is slightly less power available than is consumed.
hqhifk6 : IDK, it seemed to happen when I was trying to power my entire city off one dam. It looked like a radius around the dam where my buildings were losing power, until I built a long power line running through my city.
===============
rriawt
hqgh6xu : To fix the issues, I:

1. Reduced the speed limit on the bridge so cars have an easier time braking.
2. Increased TM:PE's simulation accuracy to medium.
3. Adjusted offsets in node controller to make the intersection slightly smaller.

Not sure which of these things helped fix the issue but one of them certainly did haha. Thank you to everyone who commented suggestions in my last post!
hqgnfbj : It’s always the way. I dunno how I fixed it but I did 🥳
===============

hqgl0oy : That is mesmerizing to watch.  Thank you for sharing.
hqgl5el : You’re mesmerizing!

rrinbv
hqgk30k : Normally before i can get this far I'm in the negative money and my people are mad at me cause i cant fix the problems in my city.
hqgjm76 : That looks like a really nice place to live. Keep at it. As long as you’re having fun, it is a good thing. Way to go!
hqhri1e : I try to control my pollution too much.  I'm always like -$7,000 and waiting for that next population bonus to hit me. lol  I need a new school!  Just 20 more residents to go....
hqi1v5j : Also a noob, but I am curious, why cross the highway lanes before connecting to your city’s main thoroughfare?
hqj2vk0 : Look what heather says in the tweet ;)
hqjnxr0 : Best advise I can give, avoid sprawl.

Pick an area and build an “island”. Then build in another area. Then another. Over time the spaces in between will fill in but you will unlock the ability to manage the traffic. Trying to keep building in only one area will bring you to gridlock because they way the game is designed.
hqhl089 : Pro tip: always start small. You can always add to your city later. Bump all of your budget items to 50% to get positive cash flow faster, and then it tends to be smooth-ish sailing from there.
hqk9pol : Getting past startup economy is literally the hardest part of the game.
hqic0dh : There not crossed. I just layed them down funny. Its just 2 one lane roads connecting to the highway.
hqlqgim : Interesting tip considering that my go-to strategy involves spending about 70-90% of my starting budget on expanding as much as possible before my treasury hits $0 with a negative income. I also bump my budget down to 50% as well as setting taxes to 12% across the board asap. By *only* doing this, I *always* reach >1,000 population and a *positive* income flow **before** I have a chance to run out of money. I have a number of DLCs including Industries(I play on PC, but I *think* console at least has access to DLC if not mods), so my next course of action is to build an efficient industry area to serve as the "economic backbone" of my city. This is the point that your tip applies the most: your industry areas should be developed very slowly and only *one at a time* to get the best efficiency and return on investment. By the time you have a *single* industry area at level 2, you should have an income in excess of $10,000 per cycle and over $1 million in your treasury if you've been expanding *only* as necessary throughout your city. And that's all *before* reaching 5k population.

hqgjxb5 : u/golfvictor115

Here's what I meant: the red paths are for all vehiles, and the blue shortcuts are banned to all except service and emergency vehicles. And at the end I widen it to the vanilla  one-way two lane street to that there's one turn lane for each direction.

Edit: This post has served its purpose, so you can delete it if it breaks rule 8 of the subreddit, modrators.
hqgkeht : Wow thanks. I didn't know I could filter different types of traffic too. Looking forward to try this out
hqgkxxh : No problem. And the vehicle restrictions option in the mod really is great. Perfect for making pedestrian streets, bike streets, multi-modal transit malls, BRTs with pasing lanes, or whatever else you fancy.

hqgomnw : Your expenses are greater than your income. So in this case you are losing $1,135 per cycle.
hqgoqt0 : Deficit
hqgork8 : That is how much you are earning a week. That shot shows that your expenses are currently $1,135 PER WEEK more than your income.

So you are like a typical government. Spending more than you have.
hqgw0vg : It is the amount of money you lose per week (1 minute on slow speed). You're heading for bankruptcy, so I recommend lowering your budgets, or following the ideas in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wzn39KcCSc)by Biffa

hqgyodr : So happy I got a laptop with an rtx 3080, I can finally enjoy max graphics on my games (I used to play on Intel HD Graphics 620)  
Now I see how nice this game can actually be.
hqh1sff : Wow, that's quite the upgrade!
===============
rrl4xn
hqh2xbx : So I assume you have road anarchy and fine road tools.

With anarchy enabled you should probably rather force the overpass to be elevated and pass the other road under it. You can also force ground version through the "hill" but I expect to see some glitches.

In the original post you linked, all roads over the highway are elevated. Do the same.

I hope this helps, otherwise just ask again
hqh67j5 : When continuing to build the highway, you should first build the tunnel entrance, then the tunnel piece, then the exit, then the part under the sun. Problems you may encounter are:

* If you build a too long stretch, you lose controll over where the transition from above ground to under ground is
* The highway might snap to the existing road; make  it no longer exist, you can draw it back in later
* There might be terrain glitches at the tunnel exit because it's directly below the two-way road; either turn the two-way road into a bridge, move the two appart or come up with some convoluted modded solution (some surface networks and walls to hide the critical area?)
hqh65wb : Managed to figure it out by using a combination of those mods and Node Controller Renewal!

[see image](https://ibb.co/6NJ94FW)
===============
rrl6mr
hqh42op : Apparently the land value dropped; what I find strange is the low landvalue at the highschool. But if you changed anything about thepark area that might explain it too.
hqh6pm7 : Any services will raise land value. Saunas are nice too use because of their small footprint and they don't stand out too much. Also public transport helps, run some bus through the area. Even if they don't get used much you can reduce the number of buses to 1 and still get the effect. Increased tax revenue from increased value will help offset any upkeep costs.
hqhcf6o : Did you change anything in the policies very recently?  Even flicking one accidentally on then off after a short time?    Rework your public transit routes?   Downgrade any of the roads to different types? Turn off a monument ? Relocate a park or service or anything like that 

I often find even after any of the above mentioned things is fixed or put back that slot of sims get stuck with this warning icon and it just doesn’t go away until the grumpy sim inside dies.  I sometimes have to wind up bulldozing a few houses just to get rid of it
hqhj5dy : Also as buildings level up they will require higher land value. If the area became busier with more traffic, the increased noise could lower land value, maybe it fell just under the threshold for the building level?
hqh9bcw : For some reason my picture didn't load or something. All houses were leaving due to low land value. However, everything was lightgreen. I think a mod caused a problem tho.
hqhavvf : Could be a mod, not sure but I see this from time to time. I use the mod show it. This tells me what services I need to increase the land value. 

I can tell from the picture that the areas are in lower land value and if it’s really 41 avg, that’s low. 

Seems odd though considering residential leveling up is partially dependent on land value
hqhjh6k : Picture shows its in high land value actually. I have my game set to euros, so its higher in dollars. 

Must've been a mod. Let the game run for a while and new houses came that didnt have any problems.

hqh4djw : A video on how to set up a cargo network that talks about how to reduce trains, https://youtu.be/wC7q3prXOUI.
hqhneqq : Wasn't there a mod for PC that doesn't allow the spawning of not full trains? (Or not not-full, but like those 17% trains wouldn't spawn thus not clogging your network)
hqh1hxy : You cannot solve the dozens of trains, but to help with train jams, you can make an exchange station where cargo trains from outside your city drop off their load and go into a different cargo train terminal where they are picked up and can be shipped across your internal network. Also, ensure there is one train length between one track intersection and the next, that way, trains can queue up without blocking the junction
hqh96ne : the amount of trains aren’t preventable but you can use one way rail lines to divert trains away as soon as possible, using 2 way lines means they can go back (which may be quicker) but this can mean they have to stop at a waiting train which could lead to a complete grid lock. so yeah the single one way train track is a good idea (looping back)
hqhq6b7 : From what I heard, it's something like: every connection sends a train to every connected station.  So it's exponential growth as you build up a train network.
hqhr0nb : Turn your train budget down as far as possible. You'll get fewer trains with closer to 100% loads.
===============
rrlg9w
hqh167v : Select the inspector, hold triangle, then select intersections, go to an intersection and if the traffic light icon is on, click x on it to turn it off.
hqh2kp1 : If you mark a street as a priority road, it will automatically add stop signs coming to your priority road when removing traffic lights.
hqh1akt : i love reddit😍 thank you so much!
hqhg9p5 : Can we do this on console? I don't think we can...
hqh1pkv : No problem, I play ps4 as well, say, did you know that on console you can drive around in a car
hqhjr8p : I know we can, I use it on the regular.
hqh24jw : you can what?!😮
hqhm1v4 : Oh really? In the same interface as the junction manager?
hqh8ptv : If you press the big grey thing in the middle of the controller, it takes you into cinematic camera, then hold triangle and you can select the option to drive around your city
hqhr2nn : No, use the selecter and hit the road itself, the option is there

I use on console regurly
hqhfiui : Look at this person coming in and giving bonus tips! I already happened to know both of these, but it still made me happy to see folks sharing knowledge and the fun!
hqh8vdy : the big grey thing😂 mines white, you mean the touch pad right? …oh wait i’ve found it! 😂 thanks!
hqhszi1 : Ah right on the actual road. Thanks for this. I'd always just look in the same I terrace and could never find it so had to adjust each intersection manually. Thanks for this!

hqjqwqt : :)
===============
rrlrfq
hqhbbjp : Turn down the budget so that (hopefully) you get fewer trains but each is fuller. 

Adjust your supply chain, ie; increase your local production from industry so you’re less reliant on imported goods OR scale back your industry zones so you arnt exporting so much.  - your import export info panel will tell you how well your supply chain is working 

I don’t know if the policy that boosts outside connections has any affect on trains or not, maybe someone else can comment on that and if that policy is on now and you turned it off it might help reduce the train jam

hqh36m4 : My focus is realism. I guess my strategy is to model a city like LA. First, built it out without thinking much about transportation, or what not. Then work with the given city, grid, layout, nature to build things out. Like, I want to focus on building a beautiful boulevard leading to the city center or the business area.

I also want to create some University areas in the city as well. Let me know your thoughts...
hqhe7b1 : You captured the smoggy suburban hellscape perfectly!
hqh4j0l : [deleted]
hqjo3qw : If you don’t mind, I would like to leave some tips:
-Steam Workshop has a LOT of visuals mods. There essential to me because the game is just so washed out. 
  - Theme Mixer 2
  - Ultimate Eyecandy
  - Clouds and fog toggler 
  - Relight
  - Daylight Classic
  - Post Process FX 
These are just the basic ones, just get a bunch of themes and LUTs and make the game look awesome.

- Make the skyline more elaborate. Add some sort of gradient to the skyline to really resemble an American city
hqkok9k : Love it.
hqnsbuu : The Sprawl!
hqkz6u4 : Make a better Switch from highrise downtown to the "normal" areas, atm it is like 100% - 10%... a bit hard

And maybe create own interchanges and get buildings closer to the Highway, maybe even elevated highway
hqhigyc : Nice but don't you think there is a lacking in suburbs?
hqj28m0 : Building it out without thinking much about transportation sounds very realistic when you're trying to make it like LA.
hqhfr0m : hahaha. Yeah - I wanted to create that suburban hell-scale, then develop parcel by parcel. Or, make it a lot prettier. Making neighborhoods more unique, adding its touch.
hqh5883 : Because I am still figuring out the game and I could not figure out how to make a district style with the low rises i want… i wanted to create density but low rise and focus on critical areas in the city to build out skylines (multiple skylines).

Because of it - the narrative i thought were european or south american city. Two main cities that expanded rapidly after ww2 and now its a metropolis hehe
hqjuu82 : Thank you, I will look into these. I really want more control over the themes and what goes into each district style. But still trying to figure it out.
hqlejxb : Yep. I am starting to work on this now … filling up areas. Creating commercial clusters or industrial zones. I realize that the downtown just rises out of no where too - so going to make that growth more organic too.
hqhjg7t : Aha. Its just a game for me, this is the way I had the most fun. :)
hqjv1y5 : Yes - I suppose LA or Mexico City is what I am basing this city on …

hqhdp5w : I currently have maybe 45 + cities that I've started and abandoned because I don't like the way it's turning out.
hqhdhwq : If you’re anything like me you will go through a few city restarts before you’re actually happy with it.
hqhek2c : Btw, this game is amazing and a little too addictive...
hqi7670 : If it’s your first one, bask in the ugliness and persevere for a while so you can get more familiar with the mechanics and how traffic builds up, how to solve different demands that pop up, etc. Try to edit things to make it better where you can. Then, when the city is well and truly broken, start a new game.
hqhgt5k : No shame in restarting a city.   We all here have had starts we weren’t happy with or had different ideas come to us ... or things just weren’t working out.    No shame in restarting and taking what you learned to start over on a new better city.
hqhix2z : Not very happy with what's going on in your city? That's okay, neither are a lot of city planners. You know what they do? Well, maybe they move cities until they find one that they're happy about, but they're more likely to stick around and try to implement new plans and change the way things are until they're happy with what they've built.

No city is going to be perfect. There is always going to be something that you're unhappy with in every city. But just like with any sort of paint canvas, you can tweak little parts - or repaint whole sections - if you're unhappy with it. Need another analogy? Molding some clay. Start out with some big, amorphous, unsightly blob and shape it into something. You get what I'm saying?

What I'm doing with my current city is growing it as it is, doing what I think I like now, but recognizing down the line when I have everything unlocked and tons of money, I can just go in and make some changes. Even right now I'm at a point where I feel stagnated but I'm going to push through it and continue on. Down the line, if I really dislike something or something isn't working real well, I'll have the resources to change it. No reason to start over and then have to work up from nothing again.

Good luck :)
hqhizjs : I’d keep going with this one until you can’t, so you are more prepared for future ones


Like this can be the city where you learn how to overcome various issues that will pop up.
hqhicfg : The game does support a more iterative way of learning.
What do you mean with you arey not happy with the city?
How it looks or how the traffic is going or a disaster has killed your city?
hqhkzpd : Depends... do you think you have learned enough that a second attempt would be significantly better? How far are you along the milestones? (Early on you have less to lose, late game you might want to stay in until megalopolis)
hqhm7xm : Restart, then restart again.
hqilnus : Trash it and move on
hqhe24f : I just think it was pretty hard to unlock new services etc at the start and make money :D Now I have money but I think it will take some time to redo all the roads etc
hqhebpd : I’d say if you’re profitable just edit what you can then.
hqiese7 : Using the dirt roads at the start of your city really helps save some cash. By the time traffic starts to pick up and you need to upgrade them money won't be as tight.
hqhea18 : Butt I think I will just go with this one and if I get too frustrated, I'll start a new one

hqi4e6i : Gotta have some discipline, don’t zone every bit of retail that is demanded. They’ll never be able to staff it all, and the goods coming in will destroy your traffic flow. 

Kinda like the US now.
hqi9yn7 : Don’t fall for it. It’s very easy to make waaay too make commercial. I’d try and keep the bar AT LEAST half full
hqicf0l : Like others are saying keep commercial and industry around 50% and any time you seen green come up for residential zone a little bit. Try not to zone huge areas all at once as it will give you death waves later on.
hqjdkvn : this may or may not be helpful, but I had similar issues with my RCI demand, including a lack of industry/office damand. turns out, the "Lifecycle Rebalanced" mod was messing with the RCI demand as well as many other things. disabling it fixed zoning demands! might be worth looking into.
hqhlthx : Reference this - https://skylines.fandom.com/wiki/Zoning

It’s not 1:1. The best way to manage commercial is to leave the bar at 50%.

I believe Biffa says commercial should be ~20% of your zoning. He can correct me if I’m wrong.

Edit: touching base on your residential demand. The demand calculation is complex but the least painful way to manage residential demand is to keep very little demand. If that makes sense
hqjk4db : since i am playing with only the 49 (or was it 25?) tile mod, this probably isn't an issue for me.
hqhmck2 : Dam.   You beat me with the link that time ;)
hqhqg4e : Thanks, will have a look tomorrow.
hqhmzng : OP- follow that link.   Then change the way you think of your demand bars.  

Green = demand for workers 

Yellow = demand for work spaces 

Blue = ratio of commercial work spaces to total city work spaces in city AND a demand for entertainment / leisure opportunities

hqhn1w1 : Assuming right-hand-drive, that’s so people going North on Windsor Parkway can turn left to transition to the other road by looping through the trumpet (notice there’s no place for them to make a right-hand turn onto the other road). The curved lanes of the loop connect to/from southbound Windsor traffic. 

I don’t see any U-turn here.
hqhmy8k : It's because it's the only way to get on the yellow road heading to the left of the picture, probably space concerns
hqhqkry : I actually clipped it out in the screenshot, there's one underneath the Industrial Lane that just goes straight to the right across it (probably to allow industrial traffic to just head straight onto the highway as well).

hqj77kf : apart from what Jordanomega1 said, try pressing the Home/Pos1/whatever-it's-called key. Looks like you have fine road tool configured to build at 12m height. (button to the left of the straight/curved road selection; allows setting road build height with the page up/down keys)

hqibdau : It's built into the hill because it has an underground cafe. Sometimes have to use a little imagination!
hqicia3 : Looks sorta cool that way to me
hqkxhmv : Not really, it’s possible to do but takes a lot of tweaking around with props. You’ll use surface props to make the ground flat, use procedural objects to place the chevron on top of them, then add invisible roads and paths to give the illusion that people and cars are moving on the surface of the props. 

They will technically, according to the game, be floating in the air, but because the surface props will be right under them it would look like they are walking and driving on them.
hqioz9p : Many buildings don't have a "foundation" so it doesn't matter how you push it up or down it won't make it better. If you want things to looks nicer on slope, the only way to go is the detailing route - use Network Surfaces & many other surface props to make things looks proper, create stairs with props or Stair Network, etc.
hqjp602 : do you plop or zone? you could move-it away from the road and make it flatter. add some retaining walls around the sides and some surfaces to flatten to the wall. another thing that i hoped would have been improved from sim city 4.  


terraforming network works good sometimes too.
hqjwkpm : You need [Terraforming Networks](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1480409620) to tame the ground under your buildings. Lay them down like roads and use MoveIt to position. You can use them to control slopes too. Very handy on hilly maps.
hqifjbh : If you use Move It to select the building and then push page up/down you can adjust it to make it a little better sometimes.
hqj54lq : Use the terrain flatten tool in advance, I sometimes created steppes with a district on each level.
hqicdjp : I like that!
hqicxpz : This example is actually not bad. Some of my buildings tend to look funny though on these hills. Like there are some where the doors are smaller cause part of it flipped underground. Weird stuff like that. And parking lots especially look odd on uneven ground
hqlqq9l : Yeah that sounds like work, not fun. For me anyway. Haha thank you for the detailed response!
hqjhqmj : Much appreciated!
hqjrcvw : I plop and zone. I've been trying to get better at making my city more intentional. I use 81 tiles, real time, realistic population and instead of using the fill all zoning I use the single square tool and draw smaller plots. Etc but I just started this so I can only get better I hope. Learning how to build on a hill is something I'd like to do and the suggestions on using retaining walls etc. Will go a long way to helping.

🙂
hqii83r : I'll try that! Thanks!
hqm69kl : Yea I know what you mean! Thats how I like to build and sometimes it’s very unpleasant and frustrating. At best its work. The finished product is usually worth it though.
hqjt3r3 : just need to make sure not to use the walls that follow the terrain.

i forget what they are called, but i have a surface pack that i use sometimes between the level ground and the slope to the wall to make it looks flat. then there is a adjustable height parking asset that i use to make parking on it.  


again, dont know what it is called, but i have a grass, gravel, wood chip 4x4 or 8x8 square that i use for filler between things. with the procedural objects mod you can use that on slopes and convert it to a procedural object and pull the sides down to make a wall with a grassy area on top of it as well.

hqimtpk : DS-PUPCI - sounds like something the road engineers in the state of Utah would dream up 😂
hqic3d0 : #FAQs

Q: What inspired your genius?

A: I watched YUMBLtv's video on his Single-Point Partial Cloverleaf design, and I knew I had to make it worse.

Q: What is the traffic flow like?

A: There is no such thing as traffic through this interchange. It is the perfect service interchange.

Q: What is the use case of the DS-PUPCI?

A: Everywhere. It is the perfect service interchange. There is nowhere it is not necessary.

Q: Wait, what actually makes this "Single-Point"? I don't see a "single point" of anything! In fact, I see SEVERAL points!

A: Shhh... close your eyes, and focus on your breathing... ignore my hired goons right behind you... everything will be okay...

Q: Do you regret your actions?

A: I stand in defiance of god, and stand proudly.

Q: Why?

A: Because I can.



Q: Is this actually any more effective than any of the three interchanges it combines? (DDI, SPUI, ParClo)

A: In all seriousness, no. It seems to carry slightly more traffic than a DDI, but less than the aforementioned  YUMBLtv Single-Point ParClo. But, I DID say I set out to make a worse version of that, so... yeah. I did.
hqiq1x0 : r/angryupvote
hqj5bji : Train tracks was like "..nope"
hqk0e7f : As an engineer for a DOT, I admire your ability to add complexity and waste money needlessly.
hqjb36t : You forgot to work in a few roundabouts for completion sake.
hqibuln : I like the part where they just cross over and ram each other for no reason like its a hotwheels track...
hqivy4t : I don't get it, why is this such a bad idea? There aren't any more points where traffic crosses than a normal Diverging Diamond interchange
hqj58qv : People may not like it but this is what peak performance look like
hqjt5h2 : I feel like a fucking chimpanzee trying to understand this
hqk01np : @op I get that the diverging diamond is something that everyone here is a fan of. But, and hear me out here put roundabouts in those positions.

I despise traffic lights if you must know
hqln60t : Her: I can Fix Him.

Him:
hqj0h8a : Only a secret Furry could come up with something *this* degenerate. I stand in awe.
hqiws3m : But will it move through the traffic in vanilla?
hqizj88 : Imagine driving this thing in real life
hqj1a0d : I actually don't see how this is better than a parclo. It still has two nodes where cars cross each other (with traffic lights)
hqjersm : Spock Voice

Fascinating.
hqkhq4y : Yeah...I'm taking the next exit. Thanks.
hqm35ro : This is amazing
hqij1kd : So noted...
hqixt6l : I love this.
hqja3x1 : I just DL'd YUMBL's instead of making it for myself, I tried though. I think I did something wrong with the light though, there are times when traffic backs up all the way out to what looks like a thousand feet onto the highway.
hqjaq2y : This thing consumes so much space, the two flyovers to turn the diverging part into a complete system interchange without crossroads and traffic lights you could also have given it.
hqjuzi2 : to prevent the ddi thing happening in the middle you could maybe have done another cloverleaf
hqjwxl0 : Is that a roundabout in the middle? That is such a tight turn lol
hqk93vb : Does it work?
hqkhx1h : Dr. Ian Malcolm would question your motives.
hqkypzl : This is such a cool design!
hqkzgq9 : This is like the interchange in Georgia. I almost crapped myself the first time driving on the wrong side of the street
hql5njq : Won't work for through traffic on that arterial. Nice try though.
hql7b2z : There is no single point element in this, although it would have been way more efficient than the diverging part.
hqlmdp2 : Your mother must be extremely proud and disappointed.
hqlzafi : Am I the only one who only uses an oval stretched clover?  Everything else sucks in comparison imho.
hqmikf7 : The intersection of I-90 and Elmhurst road in Des Planes Illinois does this and it gives me anxiety every time I accidentally drive through it.
hqmveup : So... If you merged the DDI part to a Single Point Urban, would that make ignore or less effective? You can still call it the same thing but this one secretly will miss out on the DDI part and not the Single Point Urban
hqn0zim : He was so busy wondering if he could that he never stopped to ask if he should.
hqn9vj2 : That is awesome.

Now, what if where the traffic crosses, instead of lights, one direction is just elevated in overpass fashion over the other. No more stoplights. Is that a thing? There’s probably a name for that, and a very obvious reason it won’t work, but I’m done thinking for the day.
hqnpco2 : try again, not one bit of elegance in that despite being a modded construct ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

if the interchange don't make you e***** then it isn't elegance enough, period.
hqjzwe3 : Or a tank shell abbreviation
hqlhw6l : I see your DS-PUPCI and raise you [Diverging Single-Point Urban Partial Cloverleaf Turbo Circle Dumbbell Interchange (DS-PUPCTCDI)!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/rscbug/i_see_your_dspupci_and_raise_you_diverging/)

hqjcufs : Love your honesty and it makes me want to use this interchange myself!
hqliek0 : I enjoyed this more than the screenshot
hqjzfew : r/eyebleach

For anybody who saw this terribly deformed diamond intercharge.
hqoq92j : I’m a simple man if I see an FAQ I upvote it
hql7un3 : Definitely
hqk64ta : I always do this with trains near complicated intersections. IRL I'm guessing the intersection would be elevated on berms with a tunnel?
hqm9o40 : Gotta use those federal grants somehow or other.
hqic8x0 : Eh, it has traffic lights there. Totally Safe ^^TM, trust me!
hqif5xr : The diverging diamond part? Cause DDs are real, and they work very well.
hqja315 : The traffic coming off the highway also has to wait for the cross-overs, whereas with a regular design it does not have to.
hqlav0o : For that to see you have to understand the real advantage of DDIs. The diverging part allows both letf turning flows to go simultaniously, both entering and exiting the highway, much like a SPUI, in contrast to a classic Diamond Interchange, where they block each other. This comes with the disadvantage of adding to conflict points for though traffic on the feeder road. DDIs are therefor mainly used at low through traffic and high entering/exiting traffic. Their main advatages over SPUIs ate shorter red phases to clear the intersection (only in real life) and easy upgradeable on existing Diamond Interchanges. They also are less wxpensive when new build (above the highway) cause less bridge space is needed.

Now to the post:
In short, this abomination combines all negative aspects if the used intersections. The two additional conflict points for through going traffic ok the feeder road, higher coasts of the parclo and it has one more conflict point for the left gping traffic exiting the highway with through traffic and two with each other than a SPUI.

And for that, we love it.
hqksbo1 : It is technically usable in vanilla if you have Mass Transit, I think. However, Traffic Manager: President Edition is required both to ensure that traffic flows in the right directions from the exits (I.E not making left turns across traffic outside of the diverging diamond points), as well as to sync the two traffic lights for maximum efficiency.

So, vanilla-capable, but not vanilla-friendly.
hqizrgv : Seems pretty simple. Going left onto the highway is actually a left turn, which is relatively intuitive.
hqjb1ue : The intention was not to make something good, I think.
hqk5ncy : It’s part of a diverging diamond, the flows of traffic swap sides.
hql9ia1 : Shhh.... my enforcers are on their way to your location now... please do not resist....
hqjg3ic : "Yes, please use it! All of your traffic problems will be instantly solved."

~quote from anonymous mayor who had all of their traffic problems instantly solved
hqkjn2q : Yes, it does belong in eyebleach. No, I do not have OP’s goons aiming guns at my head, why do you ask?
hqkwzck : Nah, just throw an at-grade railway crossing across a 6 lane motorway, it'll surely be even more perfect!
hqmub24 : Ha ! We're STILL building roads from the Highway Act from the 40's ? L.A.'s initial plans

hqifkz3 : Was about to say, they just put a DDI in near me and it's glorious.  I'm a fan.

As a result almost all of my cities in game have a ton of DDIs
hqj0xjj : Came across a DDI in real life in Austin. It’s surprising efficient but it confused the fuck out of me the first time I used it
hqjbgc4 : that's true, but now the cars do have the advantage of not having to change lanes.
hqizwui : Yeah it should be but I tell you so many will be fucked there. At least Germans, depending on your country you might find other designs more intuitive trough your experience on your highways.

Also you have two extra crossings that slow traffic down.
hqlb1by : Saw your QnA later and was to lazy to remove my comment, no offense :)
hqkgz5z : *Anonymous Mayor is an affiliate of Anonymous City and is most certainly not a paid actor providing false testimony, please forward all questions to our legal department.*
hqm3vv6 : Some people actually thought that would be [a good idea](https://goo.gl/maps/JhKvCmD6M37j2AsJ8) (a 4 lane but yeah)
hql5atx : There’s one in Perrysburg heading to Toledo that is just so cool to go through. I’d actually take the detour just to use it instead of the death box interchanges around it lmao
hqk6jx5 : Round Rock has one at University Blvd. Cedar Park has something similar at Parmer/Ronald Reagan and Whitestone.
hql8egq : They don't have to change lanes on a traditional DDI either, cause they can already take the right lane upon entering the bridge. Traffic coming from right (for these cars) is blocked via traffic light.
hqj050x : Those crossings are controlled by timed lights, so they don't slow things down that much. The rest of the interchange looks to be free flowing.
hqlmq8r : *Which in turn is not Corrupt and will most certainly not turn you away due to 'preposterous claims'.*
hqn2s67 : This has piqued my interest. Know any websites/youtubers that have information on this (and/or similar) crossing? Google is being a crapshoot.
hql6464 : I've been on that! It's fun to drive through.
hqlat38 : Don’t think I’ve used those ones before, the one I came across was Mopac and Slaughter
hql96kn : On a standard DDI, traffic turning left from either direction of the highway would end up in the same lane as traffic exiting left from the avenue, thus lane changes are required.
hqn4mr1 : It's a secondary railroad owned by the Canadien National (CN) Railway company, crossing Autoroute 20 in the Montreal's outer suburb of Sainte-Hyacinthe. It is used everyday by small convoys. Edit: CN instead of CP

hqlhqmu : I haven’t been out that way in quite some time, so that’s new to me.

hqj7wm4 : My method is to build the respective storage buildings for the industry, put it on "Fill" and wait for them to nearly fill up, then build up the rest of the industry and move the storage buildings back to "Balanced"
hqk46xh : You place roughly 1 small storage unit set to fill per 4 small processors.  Similar ratio for large. If you plan to import the raw material.
hqig0ei : Have you looked into the built in mods/settings? On PC there is a setting to have infinite ore and oil. You might have it on Xbox too.
hqj1aw9 : If you can't extract the raw material or will automatically import it. What do you mean by you were not able to aquire the raw goods?
hqk4kkh : Will they take from "fill" set storage?
hqihag1 : I do but I'm currently in a mod/cheat free game to get achievements (king fisher most recently, 0.17% of Cities xbox players got that so far) and am trying to expand into some other industries besides fish, forestry, and farming. I read some recycling places generate material but I don't know what kind.
hqj27vr : It says in the warehouses that most goods can't be imported, only exported. There wasn't any more information regarding any of that though in the tooltips.
hqlb8a6 : If all the storage is set to fill then they will.
hqj3sds : I see. You can only import raw materials. From there you have to create the industries and buildings to make things from the raw materials. 

Example - tree industry - import trees, or extract them locally - make lumber or paper
hqj3y26 : Is that the "zoned industry products - (industry)" option?
hqj58o4 : I haven’t tried it that way. What I’ve done is zone the industry and throw down the specific storage. Say silo for crops.

hqiqair : How much RAM you have? The most common crash is literally ran out of memory. Despite this game is old, the additions of DLCs does push the memory consumption up, and we not talking about the deep dark rabbit hole of modding yet... 😆

If you low on physical RAM, go Google how to set manual amount of Pagefile (Virtual Memory), give it a couple GB, restart and try again.

That’s not how this works.
You have the solution right before you, and many in this thread have given you pointers to some excellent content creators on YouTube who share your preferred play style - and have done amazing things, including most of what you complain about not being able to do without mods.
I hope you take stock of these people’s great recommendations because they have the potential to either get you to like your play style more, which would be valid and respectable, or get into mods, which would likewise be great. Ultimately, if you don’t like seeing modded cities on this subreddit, feel free to filter it accordingly, as someone has suggested.

hqk0cum : Maybe you should start a sub for modded cities skylines. Considering this is simply r/citiesskylines, it seems more reasonable to desire more vanilla posts on this sub and creating a sub for modded games. Also kid of a terse chirp back at OP for expressing desire for more basic gameplay images, don’t you think? Shouldn’t have even said “sorry don’t mean to hurt feelings,” cause it kind of seemed like you did.

Seriously, homeboy says it’s too bad there’s no vanilla gameplay and you respond with leave and go make your own? So they don’t appear in “your” feed, cause what, this is your world and we’re all living in it? No one cares about your feed. 

This is a real comment too.

hqk6vpr : Oh I'm quite the zoner, lol
hqj7h2p : Better roads and some way to dictate traffic. If I could even just restrict left turns... But no, here's three different 6 lane one-way roads
hqjqtfd : Yes🍰
hqm8jiy : Geeez. My comment was mostly in jest. I deliberately used wording similar to what OP had in theirs to prove it goes both ways. 

OP even saw the funny side in their reply to me. So, yeah I’m asking is this real. Who are you offended for?
hqjob70 : I think that if you use four asymmetrical roads (comes with Mass Transjt, Industries, or Sunset Harbor, I’m not sure) in a junction you’ll end up with a reserved left-turn lane. But yes, we need more roads. Even just a one lane one way and an asymmetrical two/three lane road and I’ll be happy.
hqjks76 : I do wish traffic worked better. Sometimes they are just dumb, lol. One of the youtubers, I believe it's "Seniac" talk about lane mathematics and it actually helps a ton, console or pc.
hqk749d : THIS. asymmetrical roads are the only good road we have. I use them heavily.
hql3njy : I recently learned that if you use left-side driving you will get dedicated cross-traffic lanes (right turn in that case) if you have say a six lane road intersecting a four lane road. Not sure if it's just a developer oversight but there seems to be a preference for dedicated right lanes regardless if it's cross-traffic or with-traffic. I haven't experimented with it because my brain can't compute left-side driving well enough.
hqk9d3m : I use them way more than I should. Unless the two lane road has bike lanes or a tram line, it’s gonna be upgraded to a three lane asymmetrical road.

hqj6x2g : How much does the despawn mechanic affect traffic if you don't have any major traffic jams? I have a 93k pop city on console with 90% traffic, would it likely be worse if I could turn off despawn?
hqluxxz : I just unlock everything manually. Haha
hqpo64k : Any tips, with or without TMPE?
hqj6kka : Sure. Load up a city, eliminate a key service or bulldoze parks or however you want to get people to abandon, once you unlock just reload your city and enjoy your cathedral. You don't have to wreck your city permanently for the unlocks.
hqkwoj8 : hard to tell. before i build the bridges in my current city i had a traffic of <30%. when i enabled despan, to resolve the problems for a short time, it went up to 70% fast.
hqptdfz : do not build to tight, road hierarchy ( highway-> 6 lane(city)-> 4 lane(neighbourhood) -> 2 lane). less crossings are better. lane mathematics. watch biffas videos.
hqjfbne : Once you unlock it on one city, does it stay unlocked for all current and future cities?
hqmuhg0 : Deleting water works best
hqjfrzt : It will be available after achieving it once, just like all of them. Exception are the big monuments, they need to be unlocked in every city again. I normally save once I’ve unlocked in another file, just to be sure.

hqj26gb : I can‘t see anything on the screenshot but the most important thing in the game that is often overlooked is to create many access points. 

It is important to avoid creating a single point that is then your bottle neck. Upgrading 2 lane roads to a 6 (2x3) lane road does not help as much as it would in real life because cars hardly use all the available lanes(annoying but that is how the game works)

I often see youtubers overengineering an intersection and the much easier solution would have been to create another access point.
hqj5zfv : Lots of lanes rarely solve traffic issues in this game. Connectivity, road heirarchy and lane mathematics, as well as understanding how the AI chooses paths for vehicles, are the keys to good traffic flow. Cars line up because they have all chosen the same route; they won't move to an open lane just because their lane is backed up. It takes some practice and lots of patience to get used to. YouTube is your best bet for more detailed explanations of all this.
hqj5tej : Yes, what generic-_-user said regarding the roads - bigger does not always mean better. Plenty of videos on YouTube regarding ´Road Hierarchy’ which will help your road selection decisions. 
Looks like a nice city, especially for a first attempt, but people generally feel that that subterranean road networks quickly become confusing and are unrealistic. 

And of course, ´lane mathematics’ (see YT) will help your traffic no end too. Good use of roundabouts though.

Happy gaming!
hql3jkr : This game is kinda all about traffic management, rest is just easy imo.
hqj7r9y : >I can‘t see anything on the screenshot but the most important thing in the game that is often overlooked is to create many access points.

Indeed. Everything backing up "because of the roundabout" is due to the roundabout being the only direct way to get from the other side of town to over there, and I assume there's a lot of busy zoning such as commercial. Relying on a single highway is a classic planning mistake in this game, and another newbie mistake is overlooking public transit :)
hqjbj0v : [deleted]
hqjekb6 : >The problem is that you would assume that more lanes would resolve   
traffic problems but the cars end up using 1 of 2 lanes. That is just a   
problem of how the game works.

You're right in that in real life people would just use other lanes to overtake where applicable, but simulating this would make the game unplayable on more machines than what the developers desire. And because vehicles aren't able to overtake, them occupying more lanes than what's necessary would make congestion even worse because they would block traffic wanting to go in other directions.

Traffic never using all the lanes is just not true, they will be used at least a little if there's any reason. The AI itself may be simple, but the amount of possibilities and a need for balancing makes the traffic simulation complex.

hqm1y2f : What rocks or theme did you use to get the cliffs that nice?
hqkoi8d : this looks so realistic its scary (in a good way)
hqkuvvj : Great build. Now you only need a James Bond easter egg hidden in one of the town squares. Edit: Oh wait, that was Italy. Sorry, but the design of the city looked similar to the one in No time to die. But it does absolutely give me Ronda vibes too, that bridge looks very familiar indeed!

hqnrhl2 : I use Seychelles map theme and Relight mod for LUT.
hqnrxr6 : Good question. Actually, I’m building on a archipelago with two main islands and I’ve imagined a small utopian country where the monorail line is the main artery. This line brings this archipelago to developpment with new major infrastructures (theme Park, airport, capital, beach resorts). I’ve choose monorail over trams and trains because there is few available ground space to built it, the monorail can overpass trough obstacles like cities, streets, variations of landscape and the crossing of the detroit between the two islands. And also simply because I fucking love monorails xD

hqj7vhj : What is your map theme? Are you on a European map?

European maps will be restricted to European building styles and won't get tall buildings. Either try a map with a different theme or use a mod (theme mixer?) to change it.
hqj8fej : You unlock high density zoning when you reach a few thousand residents. Be warned, high buildings need well designed infrastructure or you will end up with all kinds of traffic problems.
hqj8iff : Do you have high density commercial/residential unlocked? This along with good service access (schools, police, fire department, hospital etc) gives you the tallest buildings when it comes to zoning.
hqkzze7 : If the screenshots you are referencing are vanilla, and the buildings are more than 20 floors tall, then they might be using IT clusters from the Green Cities DLC.
hql2q34 : IT cluster in the office specialization to get the tallest buildings. Also tourism in the commercial specialization will spawn some tall nice looking hotels.
hqjgo32 : You actually don't need a mod to get tall buildings on a European themed map. The European / "Vanilla" option needs to be enabled in Content Manager (styles tab), and then in game you need to paint a district and specify the style there. This may be different on console but possible, regardless.
hqk3hp7 : On console you paint a district, use the info tool, left bottom corner is blue house icon, select that then pick the style you want.  For tall buildings it's north american.

You can try to fix this by just rebuilding those road sections, but it's not a guarantee that it won't happen again.
hqlu3qa : I play switch, and it just means that there is too much in your city and the AI can’t take it. It sucks, but there really is no solution. Quite literally the best solution is to get a different version of the game.
hqj90hm : Check on how the road conditions are, like with the road depot it looks like the roads have ice on them so I would check that first and see how to fix it

hqjefwv : Your power plant needs fuel delivery to work. Check your traffic.
hqjgc74 : Did you speed up for a minute since setting it down? Are those dirt roads? Remember, you gotta keep in mind they also have a lower speed limit, so it will take a little longer to get there anyway. But generally speaking, I feel like if you sped up for a few, it would catch up and start working.
hqjnlaq : Afaikt you have no traffic and you’re connected to the highway. 

My guess is you just turned it on and need to wait for coal to be delivered
hqkd84m : Coal Power Plants require coal by trucks importing your city coal for your coal plants so it may take awhile for coal trucks to reach their designated locations especially your coal power plants. Since Power Plants require trucks for serving electricity, smooth traffic plays a huge role for importing coal at your power plants so trucks can deliver coal much more faster. The bad your traffic the slower to import coal from your plants loosing fuel from the process. Or maybe wait for the trucks to comeby.
hqm3mzk : What device are you on?
hqjg0ex : Agree. The power plant has a road but it's not connected to the highway. Coal deliveries can't get to your plant.
hqjqhai : The UI doesn't indicate that it's low on fuel. Without more information this honestly looks like the game is just forgotten on pause, lol.
hqjofx5 : Don’t coal plants start with a few weeks worth of fuel in them? Whenever I plop one down at the start of the game they start producing instantly.
hqjtiah : Sure they do I never noticed it not work
hqkgsxj : That;s a good point. And looking again, I see your road connection -- I missed it the first time for whatever reason. I can't think of any other reason that a power plant would be offline without it being out of fuel or turned off.

If you click on it and look at the info panel, you will be able to see the amount of fuel it has. That would resolve that aspect for sure (either yes or no). If that isn't it, then we need to look deeper.

hqjo1no : You can’t zone onto the quays. If you zone first and build the quays after you might be able to get it really close, or if you have the Bridges and Quays expansion you might be able to build a path between the buildings and quay to make it look like they’re touching.
hqjjje5 : AFAIK you can't zone on the quay concrete. 

You could not use quays at all and zone right on the shoreline. If you can dry the water then put a road in the river bed so that the terrain is straight and then release the water again.
hqk32ux : Make sure you turn off the grid guide when running roads next to quays.  They interact weirdly when all guides are enabled.
hqjpgw2 : you could skip zoning all together and start plopping. then you can move your buildings wherever (so long as they are not *in* the water for a non water building)
hqk61bu : Apart from what every here has said, some structures snap to it, despite not being able to zone it. Water services, marinas, docks, fishing piers, and maybe a few more can be placed there.
hqkb4qd : Roads snap to the quay, so you can use a narrow road that follows the quay with the desired zoning.
hqkmjvg : Best bet is to use TPME and have a parallel road made. You could maybe use Road Anarchy and build roads and zones over the Quay but it wouldn’t look great.
hql4o0w : Looks like I'll need to experiment more to try and get it to look right at least. I don't have any expansions but I should look into getting them just for the extra options.
hql5065 : I mostly was using quays to try and make it look straight. If there's one minor complaint I had about this game it's that everything has to be attached to and facing a roadway so it somewhat limits what I'm allowed to do.
hql55ud : I'm not sure how to do that but I'll check it out next time I play. I did wonder if some of the overlays were messing with things a bit.
hql590y : I'm not sure what plopping means. Manual placement?
hql78rp : Makes me wish there was something like a boardwalk pathway I could run along it but yeah, I haven't used the actual waterside buildings much yet. Most of my map is hills and a couple rivers but recently expanded into an area with a lake that I'm like to take advantage of which is why I was asking.
hql606l : I suppose that might be my best bet. I have a lake in my city that I'd like to use more but this was making it hard to make it look satisfactory.
hql6d67 : Those are mods, yeah? I'm on PS4 so I don't think I have access to mods at all. One of these days I'll get a PC and really work with the game but as it is base game PS4 is all I have.
hql5ca1 : If it’s just for a quay, I’d recommend against it, but if you’re getting one anyways and want it to have quays, get the Quays and Bridges expansion. It adds a few quays that also work as pedestrian paths, and the bridges also look quite nice.
hqlbenj : On PS4, after you select the road, hit triangle to bring up a wheel of options.
hqmd1wj : On PS4 the closest I was able to get was placing the quay and placing the road exactly 4 tiles away so the building back onto the quay.
hql6uti : This seems like the kind of game where more options is better than not having them but definitely wouldn't want to spend much on them either.

Just as a side note I mostly was using quays to make it look straight but what is their actual purpose? I don't live anywhere near one in the real world so I've never actually seen one.
hqlcxaq : Oh yeah, that one. I saw it once but wasn't sure what to do with it so I didn't mess with it. Guess now is the time.
hqnte8c : I think it’s used to be able to build on the waterfront without worrying about the ground under you collapsing into the water.

hql0g1j : I've been away from this sub and the game for a while.  News of an Airport DLC may actually pull me back to this game.  If it pulls me back it will be against my will as I lose too much time in this game.  I don't get enough sleep when I play it.  I'd told myself that I wouldn't play until C:S2 was released.

Your airport looks amazing OP, good job.

hqm3v2b : coming up, yes!
hqln569 : It sounds like there are some new gameplay elements being added too. I think I read somewhere that there will be some additional management and levelling up like with the college, zoo, amusement park, and industry DLC packs.
hqly3hr : Custom assets can take a lot longer to get "right" to say the least, depending on what you're using, and even though DLCs aren't bug free, they're certainly going to be less glitchy than using assets and mods for airports right now.
hqodjhi : I had experienced this when my flight path of planes was directly over my airport. If you have the ability to move your plane flight paths, try putting it away from the airport. Or move your airport.
hql88v1 : Or /r/acecombat
hqmzysp : Thanks
hqmzzuh : Thanks
hqlym76 : I'd hope so. I mean, if there's no level up or progress system to keep it going, the DLC would be barely worth getting.

What worries me is that such a progression system might entice Paradox to try to make airports "profitable" despite the fact that there is no way a city the size of what you can make ingame should be able to accomplish that with an international-scale airport unless half of your city is going flying every day.
hqp9ako : Thanks a lot I'll try that
hqlu62l : The funny thing is that AC7s flight model isn't *that* bad, surely it's super arcadey but modern fighters can pull some stupid things on take off. I've seen F-22s on demonstration flights (I live near the base where the demo wing is) get up off the runway and then go "lol, below 80 degree climb outs are for poors" and just go into a nose vertical climb.

hqjw9nl : Your node controller offset is too aggressive  or maxed. Pull it back abit, giving the green box is at least one tile or two in length

https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylinesModding/comments/rhrkpx/node_controller_313_can_someone_explain_why_my/
hqkcq91 : Delete the segments around that node and recreate it.
hqjy1bm : Goodness, I’ve read your comment and looked at the link. I’m still a bit confused. Are you saying that the nodes need to be closer together or farther apart?
hqkdvzx : Or, if you have network multitool, just delete one of the two nodes that is too close. Only one vehicle can cross a node boundary at a time.
hqjyhq7 : Further, a road segment too short will makes the AI behave strangely.

When you use Node Controller to OFFSET a road segment for smoother curve or whatever other reason, the NODE grew bigger and the SEGMENT grew smaller. Do not max the offset until the segment is completely gone (the box preview turn from green to red), just like shown in the video linked.
hqke4fm : Or that, but only if you're on PC.  On console you can only delete all the segments and recreate it, so that's the easy answer in all cases.
hqjz3t9 : God, that’s so frustrating. I have so many spots where I’ve used the move it mod to adjust to roads to look correct. Now I have to go through all those nodes and double check them?

I thank Paradox for this great game, but I curse them for not having things like “Move it” built into the game that functions correctly. I feel like I need 100% mods just to make the game feel slightly realistic.
hqkegxf : 100

rs48st
hqkc807 : Because it is. Parklife and Industries are money printing machines.
hqkz8ly : I feel like they just give you more avenues to attack your problems. Recycling centers cost more than landfills, and don't have fantastic processing capacity, so you need more of them at a higher price, as opposed to a landfill, which really kinda just matters in the early game, before you unlock the incineration plant, which processes twice the amount, but it doesn't have the reclaimed resources.

Industries can be profitable, but they take up a lot of space, and I never have any idea what consistent money I make from them, since their profits come in bursts. I believe I can make somewhat comparable money just by building up a bunch of level 5 residential, which takes more space, but also fulfills the milestones and gets more commercial and industrial demand.
hqk45m1 : It's supposed to be easier, that's the whole point of charging more money for them.

===============
rs4s3w
hqk3e8h : Yes and no. Sounds like you are zoning too much at once. You want to zone slowly. 

https://skylines.fandom.com/wiki/Zoning
hqkda1c : That happens whenever I get too big of ideas for the city I’ve actually built. Keep growth small and manageable, and don’t outpace your education system’s ability to produce highly educated workers to populate the new jobs. Try to keep unemployment above 6% until you’re ready to expand, then make new Industrial jobs and let them fill up with educated workers, and finally add more residential to start the cycle over again. Commercial use very sparingly to prevent problems with not enough workers or not enough goods.
hqkmd8v : I don't think there's anything about population mechanics that change based on city size. You need to have  housing demand and desirable land being zoned.

If you need to raise commercial, industry and housing collectively to grow then it can be slow to induce the demand in all of them concurrently. Around 40k pops I usually work on developing each of these categories separately so that when I'm done with one there is always high demand in the others.

hqk5nky : Do you have ultimate level of detail mod aswell?
hqlvmyn : I had this happen too…something to do with unlimited trees mod I think. Lost one save game but the others are fine. LSM came up with “simulation : failed Array index is out of range… whatever that means!
hqk6ezm : No. Unlimited Eye Candy is installed although I cannot see anything relevant with this one.
hqm3m5h : Exact same error. Basically, 'something happened, please come again'!
hqk7v2w : Ultimate EYe Candy and ULOD are two different things, but those aren't the cause of your problem.

Yes, like the other said, your Loading Screen Mod skip.txt had skipped a vanilla prop that already been used in your city. That can cause this kind of super weird glitch.
hqk7403 : The only other thing I’ve seen do something like this is when a skip file is used in loading screen mod. Props that have been skipped and needed by a building you’ve placed cause something similar.
hqk9dri : Stopped using LSM a while ago, so, no, even that's not installed.  


Also, there are a ton of trees placed in places they shouldn't be - I'm suspecting Unlimited trees mod is the issue, so I'll see if everything can be reset or something, or even unsub/ resub.
hqkci4i : Off topic, but why would you ever want to not use LSM?
hqkg8yr : It was causing constant 'error' pop-ups during game so I unsubbed it - problem went away.  
Might try and load it again to see if it's now sorted.
hqkw9i6 : I see, thats resonable. Do try to make it work though, it saves a lot of RAM.
hqlcqiz : Just tried again - this time gets to around half loaded then a white/ blue blank screen overlays.  
It's not the Windows BSoD as this one just overlays most of the loading screen. Very strange!
hqlerv6 : Thats weird. If I am not mistaken the author of LSM is very friendly and active in helping people. If you give him the output.txt he might help you.

===============
rs6zmk
hqkvf7q : typical new player mistakes:

- junction, junction EVERYWHERE!!!!! Junction right after interchange exit, 9000 junctions in 100 meters of avenue...
- build too much vanilla industrial zoning, it is ugly, and generate unrealistic insane amount of traffic. If you have Industries DLC, please primarily use those.
- vanilla / terrible interchange exit design, please study Google / GoogleMap for interchange design, in fact, study GoogleMap on how roads are designed, look at your local city, how they flow from big to small roads, how far apart are the big junctions, etc
- don't understand road hierarchy system, big road > medium road > small road. Big road mean less junction, you want the traffic to pass through with less obstruction. Small service roads junctions are fine, in fact encouraged.
- excessive use of one way road, causing people that only want to go a short distance forced to take a much longer route
- built roads for ants, tiny road segment, not enough space for decent amount of cars to fit before it clogged up, especially on larger roads like interchange and avenue
- dividing the city too much, no way for pedestrian to WALK to places, highway cutting through middle of the city but didn't build pedestrian path so people can WALK to work
hqki8ld : I like to create many different types of transportation options. That really helps. Having lots of different travel options to populated areas is also helpful. Early in the game I try and separate my industry to keep trucks running through my residential areas. Early planning goes a long way.
hqkmf7z : Data would be best to help understand where your traffic issues are coming from.
hqlro6x : Try to remove the need for Cims to use vehicles. Balance production and consumption of goods and products to remove unnecessary vehicles for it's transport. Always have multiple entrance/exits to and from the city from the highways at several places on the map. Add your own highways on the map. Connect all the highways as soon as they enter your map with each other with underground ramps so that regional traffic, traffic which doesn't interact with your city can use those shortcuts instead of passing through your city.  
  
Spread your city, zones and buildings. Don't bunch everything up. Then there is the fact that your city can become so big there aren't enough vehicles, because of in game limits to jam it. Talking from personal experience of running a 1 million + city.  
  
You can learn about how good RCI design can fix traffic here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/ht0mzx/there\_are\_more\_then\_4\_zoning\_designs\_for\_rci\_but/  
  
High density buildings are not properly balanced in the game. Once you start using them don't ever stack them as you can low density zones. Leave a lot of room between zones or the traffic will wreck your city.  
  
Offices are sinkholes for jobs. If you have a lot of Cims which you need to employ use them. Industry you need to produce resources, the whole chain. Raw> products> goods. Specialized industry on resources > Specialized industry not on resources > Generic industry.  
  
If you just import, again traffic will wreck your city.  
  
Actually it would be better if you left one or two spaces between zones backs. There you can add a path and crisscross the zones with paths making good lines for pedestrian traffic which will reduce car traffic.  
  
One other thing: Public transportation is based on the games engine where you have to have free agents ( Cims representation on the streets) for them to go in and out of publics transportation vehicles. Once you make a really big city, past 500k and closer to 1M those agents get spent and even with hundreds of animated Cims at bus and metro stops non of them will go into those vehicles as they can't be given an agent by the games engine as it has reached it's limits.  
  
So public transpiration fails at that point. Your best bet is having everything Cims need down the streets by mixing RCI.
hql8rrx : My traffic has been mostly fine except for a couple places but I really do need to get more pedestrian paths going. It won't help my entertainment district with the stadium which is constantly struggling with traffic even at simple intersections but everywhere else it should lower overall traffic congestion. Hopefully.
hqlkhf3 : Also, I would say to never put traffic light stops that separate major areas of high density zoning. Consider roundabouts instead and you’ll have less headaches. Traffic light intersections can only really handle the volume of moving cims between low density zoning neighborhoods.
hqkir2c : is a better idea to put big bus circuit or a lot of small circuits?
hqkn2wv : i can send you later a photo or whatever you want  but basically i have  a highway i use for a city of 20k people and it always ends saturated
hqlxftr : so i can build highways put of the map or they need tobe conected to other highways?
hqkjmgz : I run mine like real life - I have a few long distance routes that either  cover all areas, and several smaller "local" routes. If cims want to travel across the city without making lots of stops, they can catch a train / monorail etc.
hqkp9oa : What are your import/export totals?
hqlxs06 : 1. You can build your own highways which just work to help traffic move form one end of the city to the other. These can but don't need to be directly connected the maps default highways.
2. You can connect each map default highway with other map default highways by underground single lane highway ramps because this will give regional traffic a way to come in and go out without ever going through your city.
hqku649 : let me see i just got home
hqky0l5 : i import 1850 and export 1980 aprox
hqm0pta : so i can byild highways and the cars won turn at the end and come back?
hql32c5 : A good start would be to lower your imports. That’s definitely causing some backup. There are probably other issues as well. Do you have a screenshot you can share of your road network?
hqm0vbm : As long as those highway have of rampa taking them to where they want to go.

hqkp8w3 : It’s kind of obvious, so I’m sorry for this, but keeping cims happy is kind of the whole game. Better to learn how it works than to try to change it.
hqkks8o : No, you need to click the abandoned buildings and hover over the abandoned icon, it should tell you why they left. Then you need to fix said issue- I believe that’s the only way
hql5zhe : I appreciate the help! I’m sorry if my questions kind of dumb, my game was just being a bit confusing.
hqkp62q : Ah thanks, I was hoping there’d be a mod to make it so people don’t move out
hqlarws : So the reason people move out is because they can’t find a job, which may be because they don’t have enough education. Schooling takes a long time too, so it often helps to be sure you don’t zone huge areas all at once. Try to keep growth going slowly and make sure you don’t make too much commercial which is super easy to do.
hql47ye : I duno if it would actually work to trap sims in the city but you could try breaking any paths that leave city.    

Like make all outside connections one way in with no routes out.  

This is likely to break your supply chain tho for imports / exports so you’d need to get really creative on how to keep that aspect functioning but not allows sims to leave city

Also worth pointing out that none of the bigger name creators (CPP, Lee, Biffa, Egg, BonBon, Czardus, etc) have done any sort of trailer/screenshot breakdown videos on it. I mean I'm sure they'll get early release to do a few vids to time with release but it's just strange that none of them have really seemed to mention it at all (other than Imperatur).

I've started the city of Hanatun, and this city (and region) will see changes like almost no other City in Cities: Skylines. I've started it in the Viking time period. Then we will see it grow into medieval times, then baroque times, industrial revolution times and then Modern times.

So basically we'll follow the same city/region in 5 different time periods, to see how it changes its look over all those years.

Something very different for Cities: Skylines for sure! Can't wait to show more.

hql7lam : Hello, I live in your city. I'm part of the citizens action board. We have been living in our little houses since the founding of the city. We don't want you to level our houses for the sake of your new road system! In fact, we also want lower taxes, free transportation, free parks, and more entertainment! Also, we are alarmed at the amount of city funds that you are holding. These should be spent on upgrading our schools. Also, there is a noisy blue bird outside my window constantly giving me updates about the city. Can you have the parks department come and remove the chirper? Thanks!
hql7xak : It’s up to you man. If your love your city and am pleased and want to take it to end, do it.

Me personally, I would start anew. I find that if there are major problems with my road network, it’s often more satisfying to take that learned knowledge and built it back up with a better initial design. At the same time, being experienced means I’ve gotten a little bored and I keep trying to experiment with new roadway designs which often end up as failed experiments. Any real functional road system I’ve found in CS involves too many highways then I would normally like. So sometimes I try to build a city where I limit the highway or try to use a single road highway… or just name any variation that doesn’t involve a lot of two road highways. They’ve almost always failed me.

hqljfj0 : If I'm particularly proud of my city, I won't start over. I will level parts of the city that are not planned right and re-do the road layout. I have to be in the right mood to do it because once I commit to it I'm committed.

hqlwohw : yes. you're in the trial and error phase.

wait till you have 100,000 pop and you realize that putting in a hydro-electric dam requires flooding half the city.

Bulldozing areas willy nilly is bad, but honestly some parts of early construction just don't translate well in a more populated city. It is often a good move financially and functionally to simply delete, redesign, rebuild and rezone.

hqlb9bi : At first sight you have too much zoning. 

First, commercial should always stay at 50% and no lower. 

Industrial is based on unemployment. 

Residential is based on a lot of things but the biggest weight is employed/available jobs ratio. 

Without seeing what you’re doing, I would wager that you zoned a ton of stuff everywhere. Zone slowly.  

If that’s not the case 🤷🏻‍♂️
hqlbpwg : This video explains it in very detail, https://youtu.be/bsNSTDNi-zw
hqljyiu : You may try increasing the landvalue (ie add more parks, services and transportations), cims seems to love expenive areas. Lowering taxes for small homes may also increase cims to move into the area. It's a balance act so you may need to make changes slowly.

hqlcf8p : The commercial bar should go no lower than half. If it’s lower, you overzoned. 

Ok since everything is built, you will need to wait it out. Maybe destroy some commercial. 

How is your services?  You could focus on leveling up your buildings with services which will create jobs and hopefully kick start demand again
hqqgnt7 : Yes.

You see, that is very poorly balanced. Your R zones are almost 12,000 while the rest are below 1,000. 

Your C zones should be about 2,500 at least. I zones close to that and offices as much as needed to have unemployment lower than 7%.
hqlcpte : Ok then yes I overzoned the commercial zone because I have no demand. I thought I had to zone when I have demand. and lower it
hqlet7h : Services you mean education, police, hospital...?

hql9l9p : Looks like you have done it...
===============
rsbvmd
hqlnzdx : You need more connections not more lanes as a rule of thumb.
hqlrbr1 : Try to remove the need for Cims to use vehicles. Balance production and consumption of goods and products to remove unnecessary vehicles for it's transport. Always have multiple entrance/exits to and from the city from the highways at several places on the map. Add your own highways on the map. Connect all the highways as soon as they enter your map with each other with underground ramps so that regional traffic, traffic which doesn't interact with your city can use those shortcuts instead of passing through your city.  
  
Spread your city, zones and buildings. Don't bunch everything up. Then there is the fact that your city can become so big there aren't enough vehicles, because of in game limits to jam it. Talking from personal experience of running a 1 million + city.  
  
You can learn about how good RCI design can fix traffic here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/ht0mzx/there\_are\_more\_then\_4\_zoning\_designs\_for\_rci\_but/  
  
  
High density buildings are not properly balanced in the game. Once you start using them don't ever stack them as you can low density zones. Leave a lot of room between zones or the traffic will wreck your city.  
  
Offices are sinkholes for jobs. If you have a lot of Cims which you need to employ use them. Industry you need to produce resources, the whole chain. Raw> products> goods. Specialized industry on resources > Specialized industry not on resources > Generic industry.  
  
If you just import, again traffic will wreck your city.  
  
Actually it would be better if you left one or two spaces between zones backs. There you can add a path and crisscross the zones with paths making good lines for pedestrian traffic which will reduce car traffic.  
  
One other thing: Public transportation is based on the games engine where you have to have free agents ( Cims representation on the streets) for them to go in and out of publics transportation vehicles. Once you make a really big city, past 500k and closer to 1M those agents get spent and even with hundreds of animated Cims at bus and metro stops non of them will go into those vehicles as they can't be given an agent by the games engine as it has reached it's limits.  
  
So public transpiration fails at that point. Your best bet is having everything Cims need down the streets by mixing RCI.
hqm0jvn : Idk why but 8 almost never have problems with traffic, maybe because I watched a lot of videos on youtube before I started playing the game, or because I studied Architecture and city planning is something I lobed before even playing this
hqnh71b : Bike lanes are the most OP form of transport on the game! I've literally seen some of my Cims travel the length of the whole city to get to a shop and make the return journey! 

Great way to save on traffic :)
hqlk1qc : It’s a frustrating learning curve but once you realize the ai doesn’t follow real life logic and that more lanes doesn’t equal better traffic flow in game it gets easier. 

Look up posts on road hierarchy and lane mathematics and learn those theories and traffic then gets even easier 

Console player, so I have nothing but base game tools and my traffic never dips below 90% using the above theories and understanding how the game AI pathfinding works
hqlqe0w : one tip I can offer is using the lane assignment tool in TM;PE for on/off ramps.

if somebody is entering the highway i make the people already in the nearest lane move over one lane to allow for the entering cars (and the entering cars can only enter on the nearest lane.)

if there is an exit then the lane nearest it *must* exit (pushing cars over if they aren't taking that turn.)

these two practices help keep my highways sane.
hqlwa15 : If you build for roadway hierarchy, it’s a lot easier to get them to use all lanes. Highway<->6<->4<->2 lane roads. Don’t connect 2 to 6 or highway, don’t connect 4 to highway. Build 3+ exits from each district. Mix zoning throughout so that you don’t create many commuters.
hqlentg : They never take the quickest route either.  I’ve watched them get off the highway, drive through ten blocks of stop signs and lights, and then get back on the highway.  Just stay on the highway!!!
hqlyq4t : Maybe you can try enabling Advanced Vehicle AI and turning it up to 100%. I however warn you about performance issues.
hqne776 : 1. Monorail is your godsent friend. They upgrade over big roads, AND they have a station that can be placed on TOP of said road and still allow zoning beside it. Plus, they look nice and carry a fuck ton of people.

2. Underground metro is your devilsent friend. The entry point for it is like, 2x2? 3x3? It's tiny, and it moves faster than the monorail, with extra noise. 

Utilize these to reduce the number of cars, I'm talking HORDES of people will prefer them to driving if you place yours right.
hqnp5hj : The good thing is you have mods to help your traffic. I'm playing on ps4 and i don't have any hair left 😂
hqo6r8w : Best things you can do are work on transit and walkability, followed closely by bikeability. If you zone your neighborhoods with a mix of stuff, it’ll also help. When people can just walk down the street or bike a km or 12, they’ll just do that. I did a 6-Lane “Highway” with bike lanes on a good chunk of my city and connected all the other bike lanes and now people will bike all the way across the city. Also, asymmetrical 3-lane roads are your friend.
hqprijy : **L A N E M A T H E M A T I C S**
hqpvr0v : How about stop introducing more problems to begin with : for example - THE STUPID VANILLA INDUSTRIES ZONING. Don't use it, PERIOD. Get Industries DLC!
hqpv214 : > more lanes doesn’t equal better traffic flow in game it gets easier.

it's the same for real life, more lane isn't better. Those hours (or days) long traffic jam are always on the biggest roads... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ building bigger road just isn't the right solution when automotive industries just keep pushing people to buy more cars.
hqlrfmi : Funny enough, I built a 40k population city that had a single highway running through it with custom built service roads with on and off ramps at every junction and U-turn roads. Additionally I had 4 collector roads running through the highway to connect the two sides of the city together. All the high traffic junctions have dedicated turning lanes. 

All this custom work and it’s the worst traffic any of my cities have ever had. I also spent more effort than ever insuring that I maintained proper roadway hierarchy. It just completely failed. My early cities that look completely stupid with an outrageously overbuilt highway system work just fine, but any kind of realistic roadway network is going to get slammed by the stupid driving AI.
hqls50o : >...watched them get off the highway, drive through ten blocks of stop signs and lights, and then get back on the highway.

ftr: that's your clue-in that a more direct route would be more efficient. and they're even showing you where the route should be.
hqlglwl : Yeah, and everytime I do the unrealistic lane fuckery to get more lane usage, it always backfired into sending the traffic into some convoluted route to get to a specific spot. I don’t care about better graphics, more building space, or new transit options; all I want is realistic driving AI for CS2. Even if that’s all they could manage to improve upon, I would be so happy.
hqprn54 : About the Monorail, don't forget the noise complaints, however. Not good in residential zones.
hqluexh : i have regularly good success with traffic -to the point where it gets a little boring even with De-spawning turned off.

part of traffic management is road hierarchy, etc. but ultimate success is entangled with general city configuration.

this is a simulation but it's also a game with puzzles to be solved. when they were designing the game they had to throw out a lot of traffic realism because it made the problems *un*solvable.

in my area there's bumper to bumper gridlock for 100 miles in every direction for 3 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the evening. every. single. day. and its been this way for decades. CS players wouldn't stand for that lol so they traded that off for cars that make hard right turns in the middle of the freeway.
hqmfm36 : It’s more direct for me to drive a business route to my job too.  Should I ask my mayor to tear up the road and move the businesses so that I am less inconvenienced?  No I’ll just keep taking the highway because it’s faster.  
I get your point, despite my snarky comment.  Just wish the Cims cared about time and traffic more than the mileage.  I can only make so many massive highways.
hqpvkxp : not entirely sure what cracks are the developer smoking, monorail = noisy? They probably got paid by some train/car company to nerf monorail 😆😂😄

real monorail is QUIET, MUCH MORE QUIET and space efficient. It is sad to see that monorail isn't a popular category of mod, there's very few assets available so you pretty much have to go custom station construct with what available.
hqlw9m2 : >in my area there’s bumper to bumper traffic for 100 miles in every direction.

Here’s the thing, in real life, you can have bumper to bumper traffic because humans will just leave earlier to reach the destination on time. In CS, bumper to bumper traffic means that your business will go bankrupt, lol. Of course you’re already aware, but it’s just funny to think about.
hqpinkw : an interesting thing that i noticed is that the emergency vehicles actually drive like normal people: when they see a free lane they jump into it and beat the traffic.

everybody else drives like my gramma; get in the proper turn lane even if your turnoff is 100 miles up the road.

hqlj36x : When I started building such an area, I would place my factory and a warehouse for each of its materials, but I turned the factory off until the warehouses settled into the supply chain. Later, after the warehouses had built up a stock, I would turn on the factory.

Edit: Last post of this city. Look for the Industrial Bowl.  https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/r8x0sm/last_posted_at_110k_now_at_160k_and_my_largest/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
hqn0vha : Use more effective transfer manager. It has warehouse first policy that would force all goods to sell to warehouses first. 

Also, keep warehouses on balanced.
hqlj254 : Warehouses have to reach a certain level of storage and be consistently refilled to maintain this level. 

If they are consistently below this setting level they will not send out trucks and hoard all stored items to get back above the setting level. 

So it sounds like you have either too much storage space (use smaller warehouses) or are just a tad to low on production of the lower items to keep the warehouse fully stocked to its setting level. 

You could adjust the setting level of the warehouses too I guess but it sounds like you’re very close to the right balance point and changing the warehouse settings mite disrupt this balance too far in the wrong direction, but might be worth a try. 

[Avanya’s guide here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1550292479) does better job wording what I’m trying to say here
hqlmj66 : There is also a mod called Enhanced District Services which allows you to directly control supply chains. Warning: if you apply it to an existing city, expect a few days of headaches until you sort out all of your services and supply chains.
hqlkgeh : Maybe I've got too much intermediate storage in the respective areas from "the olden days" and the processors deliver them to local storage instead. Ideally, I'd like the goods chain to go like: extractor > storage > processor > local warehouse (buffer) > cargo train > factory site warehouse (buffer) > factory.

I'll have a look if there's something funky going on in the local warehouse (if it's needed at all).
hqn0pva : That's just wrong information. 

Warehouse will sell to unique factories in any setting at any level except when they have no goods.

If you want to make all goods transfer to happen via warehouse, use 'more effective transfer manager' mod. It has warehouse first option that prevents direct selling.
hqlmnxt : That’s exactly how the supply chain ‘should’ work ideally if you follow [the visual aide](https://skylines.paradoxwikis.com/Supply_chain) from the wiki and use a storage / warehouse building at each arrow between stages of the chain in the picture. 

It’s the fine tuning of the supply chain that is the real challenge of the dlc.  Matching all your production rates to match storage building space and level settings and then matching that to the producers needs .. and then matching all of that to the next warehouses settings and the factories needs, all while keeping tabs on how many trucks are available at each of all these various buildings and where they are going. 

It’s a challenge for sure, but I really think you’re very close to having it all balanced and just need a few little tweeks to things to get it all balanced out.     

If this was my city I’d probably start back at the beginning and ensure I was extracting and producing enough of the lesser items of the chain to keep the special goods warehouses stocked up and better able to fulfil the needs of the factories
hqnzvv2 : Correct.  I was using a generalized phrasing but that’s why I attached Avanya’s guide to better word this point about the warehouse settings and how to balance them and what each setting attempts to do
hqo1fzi : I see. But i think the wording sent out wrong message. 

Warehouses never hoard in any setting. They'll just order more later on if needed.

If you're struggling to get supply, use the fill mode on warehouses to increase imports.

hqmdo1i : I’m looking at it for practice use and I can’t see any unfortunately. The 3 lane loops have 2 going across the bridge and 1 going left or right, but if it were 2 and 2 for a 4 lane loop it could be better.

hqlldr6 : The reason is the same as in the standard DDI, uninterrupted left turn. The benefit over DDI is no traffic weaving. The benefit over Dumbbell is left turn traffic doesnt come into contact with opposite direction right turn traffic on a further roundabout. The benefit over ParClo and Single point ParClo is safety.

It is such a shame that there is no per lane timed traffic light functionality. The available per direction just isnt cutting it here.
hqm646d : Probably not, but I wouldnt know, I built it far outside of my city. The few cars you see using it are from mini artificial "cities" I quickly built just to get some traffic that I quickly destroyed. It will in the connect two future villages to each other and to the highway. However construction is slow since I keep playing around with NC and IMT and building dumb little projects like this one.

hqlpfcv : More the cloverleaf ramps a bit more outward so that you have enough space between the highway for the on ramps to remain grounded instead of elevated.
hqlvh3c : As a whole...it works...I'm moreso wondering if something like that would work in real life...hence my comment about the short on ramps
hqmenms : I mean that inner lane that leads away from the bridge. Only 1 lane out.
hqmlajg : Meh.. Let them handle it.. If there is something I learned about CS is that the drivers are stupid, but don't scare easily...
hqn7tar : I don’t have a link. Search “more cowbell snl” on YouTube. It’ll pop right up
hqo2yeu : Fair enough dude.  I'm not a fan of DDI tbh.  I try to stop traffic crossing over itself (as much as possible).
hqof3a1 : Thank you
hqpe8ql : Every interchange is a service interchange if you try hard enough.
hqm8dbg : Yes, Yes! I think I see it in my mind. Of course I wish I didnt, but yes, I do. Are you going to build DS-PU/STCPDPCWS/SI?

I lost it at the "/suburban" part.
hqqiaou : My question is: "so you pronounce *all* of the consonants, or are some of those letters silent? If so, which ones?" As an English speaker, I see names like that and don't even know *where* to begin trying to say it correctly
hqmyy4u : It is nuts. Little too nuts. Thank you.

Do you mean this [side wall](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1189087140)?
hqm24xr : Summon me with u/Scoobz1961 if you make one.
hqo1ar3 : Imagine the things you can do with all that saved asphalt!
hqlqpfl : Half of the ramp has to be elevated. The other half is already grounded as you can see on this [never before released image](https://i.imgur.com/vxyoWie.png). The other side is elevated whole because of the train tracks. If I made a tunnel like the other interchange it would be half grounded half elevated.
hqlwm03 : I am not exactly sure what you mean, the [on ramps are quite large](https://i.imgur.com/Ib189eG.png), but you can always make them bigger.

That being said this would never get built IRL. It adds too much cost for miniscule benefits over simple Interchanges from which this monstrosity was born.
hqmfce7 : You mean [these two](https://imgur.com/a/G0dtYd2)? Why would it be better for them to be 2 lane?
hqmn4st : I always try to consider safety, even thought the CS unfortunately doesnt have traffic accidents.
hqm9g7b : No... my body is too weak. Go, young padawan. Finish what I have begun.
hqsjcqw : Nope, there's another trick at play. We have "digraphs", i.e. pairs of letters that represent one sound. Somebody at some point decided that instead of inventing a new letter, or using some diacritics, they'll just use 2 existing letters to represent a new sound. So "rz" is a single sound (ʐ in IPA), so is "cz" (like English "ch" in "check"), "sz" (like English "sh" in "shock"), "ch" is a devocalised "h" ("x" in IPA). When you realise that these pairs represent single sounds, it gets way easier to understand how to pronounce these words. Actually Polish is way simpler than English when it comes to deciphering pronounciation, because each letter (or digraph) is almost always pronounced the same (with small exceptions, but these don't make a big difference). So you don't have situations like with "a" in "ram" and "read" in English. That being said the words I wrote can still be a big challenge to pronounce for a non-Slav. But understanding how to do it is easy when you know the rules and you don't have to guess even when you see a word for the first time.
hqp7agp : Yes, thank you! Those are beautiful
hqmfi03 : No the ones that would be leaving the bridge out to the city on their side. Make the round snouts 4 lanes instead of 3.
hqmbn6f : Is this [your vision](https://imgur.com/a/NEnULAH), Master?

>!Also I think we are Sith.!<
hqmge6v : [These ones](https://i.imgur.com/dIJ2mm9.png) then? Two lane comes from the bridge, one lane comes from the roundabout and they all go into a 3 lane road. If I put 2 lane from roundabout and 2 lanes from the bridge I would have to increase the road to asymmetrical 3+4 lane. What would be the benefit?
hqmio3f : Yes, yes... UNLIMITED TRAFFIC FLOOOOOWWWW!!!
hqnbt48 : Omg why? Just why? 🤣

hqo1j82 : We do what we must, because we can.
hqob1ze : The god had mercy on us all, thats why.
hqmhzq8 : So I was right. The first part is 4 lanes. Three goes to the bridge, one for turning left. If I made two go left and two to the bridge, it would increase the offramp capacity, but reduce the artery through traffic capacity. That sounds like a bad deal to me.

hqn0aq9 : I like your grid design and on the first look it all looks pretty good. However once you look closer you realize you are making the same mistake over and over again. [You are paving roads towards nowhere](https://i.imgur.com/ZPRwurh.png). I circled roads that seem like they could be great for direct long distance connections but abruptly end. The red ones might become traffic problems and the blue ones are missed opportunities for direct connections across your city. 

People build those roads to get from one place to another, not to create a road network. Dont needlessly end your roads in a T intersections.
hqmovhp : This looks really good, just don't try to fill it too fast. Also keep in mind where your main roads are so you can properly place your commercial zones too. Residential placement looks like it won't clog either, just be aware of the single entry and exit point, because that will clog pretty good without an alternative route to at least leave. 

That left side looks like a good spot to add it, but it looks like you had something in mind
hqlyhxn : What I like to do is to first start with my 2 lane roads. Then I add parks, campus, zoo whatever. Then, I get my freehand road tool and just plop some 2L roads. Then I try to match it.

hqmfjkr : You know, I really wish that the base game gave you more control over the depth and shape of parcels.
hqm93fm : in the screen shot you have a building that doesn't have a road connection. it had one before but that has clearly changed.

unless you connect it or de-zone *and* bulldoze the building you'll have a problem with crime that is inaccessible to police (which is that little hooded man icon in the corner.)
hqmfrls : Or be able to draw and erase grid zones in the same manner as the District Painting
hqmcji5 : Would the police helicopter service solve this crime and let the building carry on as normal despite no road ?   

I suspect that without proper road connection that eventually it’ll be a trash issue that forces this building into having to be looked at again
hqm9k9k : The crime notification is why I noticed it in the first place. You are right I used Move it to center the small ornament inside the roundabout but I had no idea it would mess up the grid hahaha.
hqmg3a5 : The thing is that I had noticed the crime icon earlier but obviously I let it resolve itself, and I paid more attention when I saw that it wouldn't go away. So I guess the answer to your question is no, I have heli depo nearby and it didn't care about that house.
hqmdqkb : you really just need to unzone and bulldoze.

its not just police who need road access; fire, garbage and healthcare will also need a road.

rsg6w1
hqm7tvv : I play PC (but I came from console). Way back when for a good looking and well functioning city it might be a 50 hour savegame or more for a good looking small but functional city. As far as deleting and restarting areas, I did it on console and I do it on PC. I mainly do it if I don’t like the way the area looked, the traffic in the area is horrible, I’m making way for something different (is park, new district etc) or most commonly if I’m re-routing a freeway train or busway
hqmc305 : I find now that I have multiple cities on the go on different files.    

I’ll play for days on a project that’s basicly all grid and maximizing space and focused on functionality over beauty 

But after a few days I’ll switch over to an other save file where I have a city that’s slow poked along in terms of growth.   I’ll play it for days and sometimes only expand by a few blocks or have spent the time hyper focused on getting an area looking ‘just right’ 

And then other times neither file interests me when I turn on my console so I start a new map and just sorta see what happens 

Inevitably I just sorta keep going back and forth between files depending on my mood or what I feel like working on, and yes sometimes that means logging onto a file and having a better idea for an area so a bulldoze it and redo it and set out to rebuild with my new ideas for the area.   

Some of my saves are multiple months old and still being worked on while others might only survive for a few days or weeks.   I do have a file of my very first 100k city saved tho and I love going back to it for the nostalgia and laughs at all the rookie mistakes I made but somehow made it work.  (.... soooo many yanky interchanges and 6lanes roads in that city as my uneducated self attempted to fix traffic issues that’s its comical to look at) 

I rarely use the unlock all of the unlimited cash cheats, unless I’m starting a new map with a very specific idea in mind and I’m really eager to get it laid out and see how it works so that I can sort of see any faults with it before I implement it into one of my other projects. 

I usually always turn on the unlimited oil and soil cheats tho at some point in my projects tho.  I may not start with them on but I usually give in to my desire to terraform maps and turn on the soil cheat and then that eventually leads me to using the unlimited oil and ore one
hqmjqom : What do you mean by functioning? If you mean profitable I can turn a profit around a population of 200 (I've been playing for about 7 months on XBox). Aesthetics are so subjective and relative to what you want to achieve. I have yet to make a city I'm satisfied with from an overall aesthetic standpoint, but I seem to learn one or two things every build that I can incorporate into my next build, whether it's an effective interchange or just a nice looking park design. Learning this game really is a process.
hqmnwwp : I'm on PS4 and it takes me about 2 months playing roughly 3 hours a day to build some of the best functioning and aesthetically pleasing console cities with population around 100k.  I play normal money milestones locked.  So that's around 200 hours a city and I've build maybe 15 cities now.
hqmilgi : Awesome thanks! I've learned so much about infrastructure ever since starting to play this game because it kinda forces you to lol. But I was getting down on it because I see all these amazing cities being shared and I have yet to make 1 aesthetic and functioning city lolol. I guess practice makes perfect!
hqmjdp4 : 1700 hrs of console time playing and I still learn things here but yet don’t feel like I  have cities that look as nice as a lot of the things we see posted here

hqqk23h : It’s the Mass Transit DLC
===============
rsjg8r
hqmznfa : I wouldn't say that the DLC roads improve traffic all that much. Many of the options are special roads for public transit like monorails over a road, tram tracks on a road, bike lanes on a road.

The exceptions to this are Industries which add 'Industry Roads' that are cheaper but noisier than generic roads, and Mass Transit which adds 2-lane and 4-lane highways. These highways are probably the most useful for traffic management as they allow 'lane math' to be used. Mass Transit, IIRC, also includes some asymmetric roads which can be useful.
hqn4w8f : Learn lane mathematics and invest in public transit and bike networks early on. That’ll help traffic flow. Also don’t group all residential, commercial & industrial in just one part of your map. Those tips have helped me manage traffic pretty well on PS4!
hqmw6hf : Yes. Sunset Harbor, Snowfall, Mass Transit, Industries, After Dark all offer new roads. With Mass transit offering the most.
hqmwapi : Thanks

hqmv782 : Cims don't use logic in many of their choices, they can work across town even if there are local commerces or industries hiring and they will have to make the commute. Their choice of leisure is also random in my experience, with Cims doing all sorts of crazy pathings in order to visit a Pier or Japanese garden. 

To be totally honest with you I don't feel public transportation solves any traffic issues, I never noticed any difference, except when we are talking about tourists, those absolutely love it. 

Also, I set my metro stations around 2-3km apart from each other, which I consider a minimally acceptable distance, and in largely residential areas it's seldom used, but the lines connecting opposite sides of town are very busy, and you may want to give the metros good access to the station because they really do congest. Sometimes I see 6-7 metro trains in a line waiting to use the same station, which is obviously proof of bad planning from my part. I try to stick to 2 types of public transport and very good bicycle and pedestrian access and I have no traffic issues, always over 80% flow with no traffic backing up consistently, problem with city services or whatsoever, no mods btw.
hqmv3fk : I don't think trams are perticually noisy, if you have that dlc.
hqnnlpq : My brain's a little fuzzy but in either a mod (if you can use) or possibly in the default game you can click on a road segment and see where all traffic of all types are going through it. This does help in visualizing your major traffic flow.

Overall, as I play in Sandbox, I somewhat go for esthetics as well as function. But my methodology for creating my transportation is always the same.

The earliest parts of my city are always built around usually rail stations and also subway above ground. These are central nodes feeding to the main station as spokes.

As I grow these lines out and go further apart then I'll consider cross lines to further connect. Usually these nodes will be your central districts as you grow up where commerce, office, industrial and high density residential will form. From there I then fill in buses or trams and local connections where necessary.

Only when my city really grows big do certain areas more favour car as the primary means to move around. They may have a train station going to the core but that's it.

By doing this hub and spoke strategy, like in real life, your cims will have a choice in how they get somewhere.

So knowing your sims are going to work and shop wherever in your city, think about how could someone get there. And built to accommodate it.
hqnsc6c : Cims do visit other residential buildings. I had two this morning when I was clicking through to see where they were travelling to.
hqob2id : Since you’re using a zoning strategy that already takes advantage of the cims willingness to walk locally, you probably won’t see a high demand for public transit.

Based on your total population of 40,000, you probably don’t have too many high density areas.  I’ve found that public transit really comes into play is linking large areas of high density residential to similar commercial areas that are separate from each other.
hqq176v : Pub Transport to me is mostly glitter.

back in the day i would pack my cities with massive webs of mass transit and then struggle to pay for it all (without actually seeing any significant benefit to traffic issues.)

today i go the opposite and have a much more rewarding experience:

i start a build with only one basic bus station and one line. i budget buses at 50% and i have the transport mod so i can further reduce the number of buses to 25%, the barest minimum. (if it weren't for industry needing connection i wouldn't start with any buses.) each major zoning section i add to the city gets one stop on the one line in the most ideal place (i.e. at the university or whatever major attraction.)

i build my road network to work by itself and solve those problems without any pub transport help beyond the buses. when i get to 20-30k pop i usually start making decent money and then i'll start to expand on transport and other expensive frivolities. i.e. monorails make the coolest acrobatic spirals and patterns and rings above the city (Roundabout Builder allows you to break the ceiling on transport networks, fyi.)

so, glitter. that's where i'm at with Pub Trans.
hqqfl24 : It’s because you have a well placed city. It’s so well-done that pubtrans is a niche for cims that want to travel inter district. IRL cities are not always perfect, so public transportation is annecessity.
hqq8090 : Yeah, I guess this is my issue, I've already played for long periods of time while scratching my head about the value of public transit.  I already know cities can function perfectly fine without it, and when you add it (especially trains) you get a sudden massive drain on finances for no noticeable benefit.

I guess the main/only mechanical benefit is causing commercial and industrial to level up!

But what prompted this post is that I see so much advice about using it, how to use it properly, etc. and none of that has ever seemed to match up with reality.  If it truly doesn't, and it's all fluff for the sake of making a realistic-looking city, then I can accept that.

To be honest many parts of the game are just glitter.  All entertainment buildings being more or less identical and just a function of weekly cost vs. amount of entertainment it provides + capacity.

hqn4e55 : Having built a few interchanges on Vanilla, it's important to have your exchange planned out. I'd suggest you make a stack just follow [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Stackinterchange.svg/520px-Stackinterchange.svg.png) layout, personally I keep things at 4 levels. 

I like to have the two main roads be on ground and slightly sunken. Then the flyovers being above those.

It helps to create a bunch of 'reference heights' along with the flattened terrain.
hqmuv1c : I just make a big rotary, then you can spit off however you want.
hqnfwn7 : I spent around 3 hours on a stack I made but it came out good
hqnixoi : Four stacks are hard to build in this game, but worth the effort IMO. Look up some videos and guides, it'll be exactly like yours but better looking. No judgement if it's frustrating, though, I nearly tore my hair out a couple of times trying to build them without mods.
hqnwjv8 : atleast its better than my on and off ramps..
hqo4wod : what if I tell you 75% of difficulty is due to the (small) size you chosen to built it?

real interchanges are quite a bit bigger than that. Next time don't make your life harder, go measure & take references on Google Map first. In case you didn't knew, one tile is 8 meter x 8 meter and one area tile is 2km x 2km. Make your construction with suitable size.
hqoq6xg : With direct flyover ramps like that, you want them to cross left of center, that way you can fit two of those ramps on the same layer.
hqnntax : I often have one main road underground, just so it gives me a little more freedom in placing pillars (important for looks, or if you play vanilla).
hqo4540 : Thank you
hqn1ai1 : That's it. Use circular rods as templates and build of them. Works best for me on console
hqo47mu : Thank you
hqo6t7e : Oh I know that making it bigger would be easier but I'm on console so space is limited
hqozqvo : Oh yeah, I'm going to try that. Thank you
hqnqtkc : Personally, I don't love the main road being underground, just because I feel like it's not what would happen in real life. But sometimes it's unavoidable, but I'd rather take the time and make it look good.
hqo4103 : Circular roads?
hqqzvdp : yea the limited tile is probably a pretty dumb idea and forces people to not build things properly. **There are already hard limit of objects you can construct**, the system performance can be just be managed by these objects limits; the tile limit as far as I concern, is a completely unnecessary function.
hqnr7oc : Yeah I feel you. With MoveIt and Road Anarchy I can spend hours on an interchange. On console it's an absolute nightmare tho.
hqslda9 : It probably the thing I hate most about console, I've had to abandon cities because I didn't have any more space
hqnvwg1 : Yeah I installed it on my girlfriend's PC. No mods. I spent 3 hours trying to make a simple stack, but getting the distances and layout right... I had never been more thankful for mods rush right after that.

hqnkywi : Every asset you subscribe to is non-vanilla. Unsubscribing network assets without removing the placed segments can break your save file. Also not all mods will break your save file if you remove them.
hqpwmim : vanilla assets are what is in the game before you subscribe to anything.

if you unsubscribe from a custom asset that has been placed in a map then that asset will disappear from the map.
hqpyt4i : >If I unsubscribe from a (vanilla) asset, does this have an effect on my current cities?

I don't think that question is worded correctly, as subscription means custom user made mods, even if it is a modified vanilla building.

Just FYI, yes you can remove vanilla assets so they don't take up memory / system resources. It can be done with Loading Screen Mod 'skipping' mechanism. But I recommend not to modify/add more skipping while you already started your city, as skipping certain things that already been used in your city, can cause really really weird bugs. Buildings are fine to skip, but don't do it on anything else like vehicles and props when you already started your city.
hqqtzvg : Will the custom workshop asset disappear even if it had no mod/DLC requirements?
hqqvd42 : yes. subbing to custom assets means you download the asset to your local files and that's how it appears in the map.

un-subbing removes the reference to the asset so it is no longer available to the map.

most assets don't require mods but are commonly updated for use with all DLC's. if the asset is one that will *only* work with a specific DLC that will be shown on it's Steam page with the corresponding DLC in the "Required" box (i.e. a working fishing boat would require Sunset Harbor to work.) but when the developer just includes a banner that says, "Works with After Dark" that just means it won't break your game but it isn't a requirement.

hqnfs9s : One of the mods clearly added something in your city that the game can't find anymore. Try to remember what you removed, reinstall them, launch your city in "try to recover from simulation errors" in LSM settings, remove what it added to the city then remove the mods again. Needs a lot of tries to do, don't save until its fixed, otherwise you will corrupt your city.

hqo0v67 : Best thing I've seen on reddit today
hqo4sl0 : Got a tutorial?
hqo5aif : i get how this is possible, but also i dont. how did you manage to make the parking spots connect with the pedestrian elevated paths?
hqoreu2 : This is a weird comment but: this looks like one of the cap points in the Shangai map in battlefield 4
hqnxjcl : Nice
hqo5hrz : Awesome utilization of these paths!
hqpc9hw : This has some serious BF4 Siege of Shanghai vibes
hqo6o5u :   
in real life one of them is located near my house
hqoem88 : Well done! The whole weird shaped lot on a slope thing reminded me of the parking lot in Pioneer Square in Seattle. It was built with the same mindset
hqogphk : It looks like that Battlefield 4 stage
hqovstr : Looks good but i guess it has no function
hqp1391 : This has been done in real life! Next time you're in Seattle go to pioneer square and see the [sunken ship parking garage](https://images.app.goo.gl/hFeLB51bvtENsDLU6). 
It's designed so each of the four levels is street accessible.

hqo6q7q : Excellent!!! Everybody quick go sub to Chiliplayers youtube!
hqrbmrs : oh hey it’s you, pretty good tutorial. found it a while ago
hqo6nhp : with some custom asset parking markers they could be made functional but these arent no.
hqp54ge : It’s less covered windows than if another building was in that space, especially if it was equally tall then you’d be stuck with 0 side windows
hqo2y29 : /r/fuckcars
hqo6xxb : no but i did twitch stream this a while back when i built it. dont think the VOD is up still but u/chiliplayer has made a youtube video of them making a similar garage (better looking if i may say so) so you could check that out! link is in the comments already.
hqo6u2e : node controller lets you edit the elevated paths in insane ways, thats basically whats happening here. the parking spots are just decals with prop cars placed on them ;)
hqorz6n : I immediately thought this. Kinda feels like home. Thanks op.
hqqz9am : Damn, ure right, know the one you mean, the one where the opposing team  mbt would just run me over on the bottom floor and where id simultaneously be shredded by 30mm attack helicopter gunfire while taking refuge on the top floor.
hqr8nx5 : I tought the same
hqpk4px : That’s a really cool design.

My hometown’s downtown has a few hills so I’m used to garages with entrances on 2 levels. But 4 is amazing
hqqzsyg : This is probably more common than you think. I can think of atleast a few of these in my reallife hometown of 38000 people
hqqzzdv : 😅
hqr06z9 : True, older version has more options for this i think, its the one i use atleast
hqskgw0 : Keen eye! ;) No youre right the cars are props here, could be made functional with just one or two more assets but im satisfied.

hqo4r33 : What?
hqo6f12 : ree cars bad always use public transporterino
hqo8bu4 : Oh, so it's not functional?
hqo8ebf : How about the curving fence at the back?
hqoi2l7 : I have this same thought daily. Practice is key, I know. But the sheer number of mods needed to make creations similar to what you see on this sub is so intimidating. It’s like, “Where do I even start?”
hqqy2v0 : As long as someone does it and shares it, you dont have to be! Thats what the community is for in my opinion.
hqqybd0 : Tbf i probably do lol.. or oof.. whichever applies most
hqsfsw7 : That would've likely been actually true when you made your comment.
hqpcz48 : Which is part of why it's so fun to overcome with good transit!
hqph7yx : Yeah I started playing this game with the express purpose of building cities around transit systems instead of cars, just to prove a point.

My end goal is to make a city that has no car use whatsoever and no parking spaces, with the exception of emergency service vehicles and transportation of goods.
hqphyig : I'm also fond of

/r/left_urbanism

  
😊
hqo4vda : They take up a ridiculous amount of space and are the most inefficient way to transport people.

ie: resulting in space inefficient parking lots that block peoples view, like the one in this picture
hqo9p2t : Where Next? Tips for Getting Through Life After Being Portrayed as the Soyjak
hqqyvzf : Sorry to say no, there are ways but i didnt go there here
hqokff7 : Thats just normal handrail of pedestrian bridges
hqoicll : Right? And then 4/6 the mods will be incompatible or fail or any number of things.
hqqlwiy : My problem is that I don't really know how to make a realistic city, making a logical road design is complex. There was a post days ago that showed a kind of highway intersection with tracks crossing each other and passing over each other, the thing is that it looked realistic adding the graphic mod(s) that were being used, in terms of design it really looked cool.

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/rnsxxm/spaghetti_al_dente_i5_i57_interchange/) is the post I am talking about.
hqpsvny : I feel that my cities all have labyrinthian pedestrian tunnels all throughout the underground areas with staircases up to nearly every block.
hqrpanb : Who the hell downvoted this?
hqo6k3c : absolutely, this is garbage land use. i love building things in this game that i hate in real life, like highways, massive airports, golf courses, parking structures etc
hqoksl0 : You should use the "compatibility report" [(link)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2633433869) mod by finwickle. After you start up the game (even if it's only up to the main menu) it generates a report in the which tells you what mods are outdated, which are incompatible, etc. It also tells you what mod you could use instead.


It has more than 1500 mods in catalog, and is up to date as of writing.
hqr4vnu : My advice is don’t over think it. You can always go back and re-do anything. I felt like this for years until just recently I was able to build something that might pass on this sub. Practice is key too. 

Maybe start with a downtown area, then design the road networks and public transit around that. Check the topography map and make the roads follow the land extending out.
hqpm0b3 : I like how the solution to having so many mods, is another mod

hqoxxo7 : Yeah I’m getting pretty close to maxing out my ram lol, guess it’s time for an upgrade 🤷‍♂️
hqp6ecw : I don’t have the campus dlc, but I have a lot of industry and parks, along with some modded universities. If you’re on pc and don’t already you should get the realistic population mod and the 81 tiles mod, that’s the main driving force behind the large amount of space and high population for me
hqp6gqd : Console unfortunately

fire departments could make regular inspections of commercial and industrial properties and thereby lower the associated fire hazard for those buildings.

===============
rspj0i
hqntwkd : Very likely that your city may only be making money when the citizens are working rather than traveling
hqnu4wm : Perhaps. I think it may be because lots of people use the metro system to go to work, and that's creating a lot of transportation expenses

hqo0vzt : good, but do you have good protection against noise polution?

that will still occur even with sound barriers

you could make 6 lane, 4 lane or 2 lane roads with trees to prevent this

BUT it looks amazing, use your own fantasy :)
hqo2xmy : This could definitely just be my personal preference, but I'd include more green spaces. Atm it feels like a concrete town, so maybe some more parks and trees.

Great job otherwise!
hqoxiwc : How did you make this city plan? Is there any mod or did you do this by yourself? :v
hqo1ynj : Thanks for the tip, I have offices bordering the highways, which arent very busy right now, and they arent complaining at the moment but they might soon when the highway starts to get used more
hqoqjzy : I really forgot about adding parks and trees, I probably will now and thanks
hqpt3ew : I did it by myself after lots of failure I finally came up with a good enough grid and plan to do it
===============
rsqx8a
hqo2pvl : Iirc, you can use the MoveIt mod to do that. You just select and copy - but I could be wrong
hqo2wks : Move it Mod can do that

In Vanilla your only chance is to make the intersection in the editor (thats what I did before using MoveIt)

(but yes, most functions of MoveIt should actually be part of the main game, I consider them essential)
hqo852r : ok to make it clear i am console so i cant have move it and to be honest it is just essential for the game itself think about that
hqo2iav : Wot
hqo2lao : On PC their 100% is definitely a way too ...I think you make the asset in content manager and save it ...then you can use it like a downloaded asset as much as you like
hqpuk5v : i agree. i use Move It like the others below but being able to copy and paste in a program should be a fundamental part of any software, imo.

i would only add that Move It has it's issues and when copying/pasting its my number one culprit for map corruption. a complicated set of nodes being pasted into varying geographies is dicey at best.

hqoh2gc : This a legit thing that happens in game ?
hqqg255 : I'm sorry but

* The first car has a big dent at the front but its brake marks show that it made a sudden left turn and stopped but nothing to hit at the front. unless there was another car that fled the scene, but there are no broken parts on the road. no hit at the back of the car or at the sides.
* The car that took the maneuver seems to be in an angle that doesn't make sense if it came from where the exit is, and also the dent is soft and in a position to hit the car right in the front and not from where the headlamps should be, which add to the confusion.
* The guy who tried to avoid the accident must be dead.
* There's a 4th brakes mark between the two black cars that don't fit the first car movement or other cars, which can imply an eyewitness that fled the scene, I think your police department should find that guy and investigate what really happened there.
* I clearly have no idea what I'm talking about and no idea why I take this so seriously
hqorvfq : No, i used assets and such to create this scene
hqqi92v : OK. Just to get shit straight i used some random wrecked car props and tire mark decals. So the lightly damaged car went on the exit but midway it sopped and make a 80° turn because they accidentally took the wrong exit. The totaled car near the police van and firetruck braked hard, which is the brake marks at the traffic control vehicle and still hit it. The car that took the manuever swinged to the side and that car activated parking brake. The person who avoided it was close to that car that crashed into that other car so tried to turn right to evade it but lost control and crashed into the sound barrier. The 4 tire marks are on the right the lightly damaged car and left 2 the car that hit the lightly damaged car. The person that hit the sound barrier is in critical condition but not dead since airbags deployed. Not everything is perfect, also stop taking some virtual news over a pixelated game so seriously
hqpjl8m : Ok cool
hqqiipa : Man, I was joking, I didn't really expect it to be real and I was probably wrong about most of my assumptions, good job on the scene.
hqqimuj : Thanks

rsrpbr
hqo4z8x : Crashes are almost always a RAM issue. How many assets are you running and how much RAM do you have?
hqo5g2z : increase pagefile (virtual memory), Windows is too stupid to allocate more by itself automatically.

memory usage depends on your DLC amount and assets amount & their quality, let say 2000 assets = 30GB usage, 5000 assets = 60GB usage, etc. You can check the usage under Task Manager > Performance > Memory > "Committed" usage amount, when it hit max, game crash, as simple as that.

>after a while of exiting and saving 

not entirely sure what you mean there. But just in case - never quit to main menu. Always complete close the game before load another save.

//--

there are a couple of mods that might causes crashes, one I know is anything that adjust camera FOV...
hqo5k0h : Save often, don't keep adding mods without regard for crashing. Some of the mods that you can find in the workshop are solid at keeping saves stable.
hqo6tcb : Have multiple saves for the same city. Especially if you use a bunch of new mods or assets.
hqp4lvp : It means you have very low amount of RAM for game. Turn on virtual ram, set it to 15000-25000 Mb, VRAM is of course much slower than normal RAM, and your fps will be lower, but at least, it won't crash. Otherwise, buy more RAM
hqo55m4 : My most recent save has 1163, I have 16GB of ram and it ran into the same problem my other cities ran into, it was fine for a while but then it just started crashing out of nowhere
hqo5we5 : To clear the confusion, when I first load my new city it’s totally fine and it continues being fine for a while, then it randomly crashes while loading and keeps crashing from that point on.
hqo5e72 : If you’ve got a bunch of DLCs, 16GB fills up very quickly even before adding a thousand assets.

Increase your pagefile: https://www.thewindowsclub.com/increase-page-file-size-virtual-memory-windows
hqpszt9 : what's happening is that a new map is simple to run with little ram but as you add zones, nodes and assets the map requires more and more ram. eventually you get to the point where the computer runs out of ram and can't load the map.

since you'll never have enough ram to load 1000+ assets on a map you would be better off un-subbing half or three quarters of your assets (use "favorite" to keep track of them) and then choose to sub the specific assets that you want to use on a specific map.
hqpwog9 : 16GB is nothing for city builder games *(this game isn't the only city builder games that eat memory like crazy, that is just the nature of how such game type works)*, seriously just go set 100GB for the pagefile and you will be fine until hitting 10k assets mark...

pagefile should ALWAYS be on the fastest SSD storage drive, goat forbid you try to put it on the turtle harddisk...
hqo91t6 : Does it matter what drive you use for the pagefile? Does it have to be the same drive cs is installed on?
hqpxf7w : Thanks for all the help, I really appreciate it dude.
hqo95qf : It should be on the same drive that Windows is installed on. It doesn't matter where Cities is installed.

Mind you, you are bound to get gridlocked after a while. Some entrances are too close to each other.
hqobcxr : But.. why ? :O
Why didn't you make a Y junction ?
hqpww7f : If you add a toll booth, does it count as admissions into the amusement park?  This bad boy is a ride!

Now airport DLC is coming out, will you give us more content like this?

hqpia2c : I came for the pretty pictures but I stayed for the gentle prog instrumentals n__n
hqpkrsg : OMG, This is beyond my comprehension...
hqpl40z : this is sick, will you make a post about your thoughts on the new airport DLC
hqpmvvq : Functional? Or does the game only work on pause
hqpquqx : Yeah, it's alright I guess /s

But seriously, incredible.  How many tiles does that take up?
hqprfgk : This is insane!!!!!
hqpv72z : Passengers per month: 137
hqpwaos : Now for the rest of the city!

(Just pullin' your leg OP, looks incredible)
hqq7kh4 : Just in time for the DLC 😂
hqqci8h : Amazing build. You gonna do the rest of the city next?
hqqh090 : Lol, it's so good that I thought I was in the Flight Simulator subreddit. That's nice! :D
hqqnzfv : This is one of the most incredible builds I’ve ever seen here. Amazing job!
hqqt6yj : time for paradox to release a dlc that fucks everything, good work tho looks beautiful
hqqtp9i : wow - that second shot is so convincingly realistic, even after looking at it for a few minutes. And your attention to detail is truly impressive. I'd agree about airports in CS, Ive always shied away from them because I figured the time and assets needed to make them look good would be too much for me.  Very solid work!
hqr2bfb : Amazing, and just in time for the Airports DLC, can't wait to see your creativity once that come out 👏
hqr6jxu : Do you have the build the buildings on your own?
hqr7nks : Just in time for the new airports dlc and you can start all over lmao
hqr8wh6 : Is this available for download as an asset?
hqrcc6d : This is incredible! There's so much detail and so much to look at in every pic. How does PO work with over 100k objects? Because I'm working on some high object count buildings so I looked up the limit cuz I was worried about it. Most people were saying the game won't save after 10k so how did you manage to get so many?
hqrhsmj : Holy shit bro
hqrrfqh : And then the announce the airport expansion in 4 weeks! Lol
hqrukj5 : Wow! Just wow.
hqrz76a : Well not that you knew but you could have just waited! Jk, this is beyond epic, a magnum opus even.
hqs3w88 : How stoked are you for new dlc?! Awesome work. I restart at 80k all the time
hqsikqh : That train line by the lake is so sick
hqpg4px : You did in 3 years what Berlin engineers have tried to do for 14 years, build a succesful and operational airport!
hqrtujn : What airport did you take inspiration from. The raid that goes under the runway looks similar to Sydney Airport in Australia.
hqphsa9 : 120 and 35 doesn't seem that many.
hqso85j : 120k proc objects and 35k props?? really? I mean, your work was fantastic, but where are this amount of props?
hqobnc6 : Airports in cs is the greatest challenge in my opinion - and i like a challenge!
Also it’s been very interesting to learn about how airports work 😊
hqra6wq : The terminals remind me of Atlanta’s airport.
hqoo8q6 : Yeah 🙈 Thanks! 😊
hqocv7k : Thank you!
hqoehwr : Thanks! I’ve started working on the next youtube episode (a massive showdown of the whole airport). After that i will continue building the city itself 😊
hqofurv : Thank you! Yeah i will probably revisit and change a few things 😊
hqoi5x9 : Thank you! And you’re probably right with the dlc around the corner, and i will expand the industrial area around the airport as well. Glad to hear it has been an inspiration!
hqow863 : Thank you! Yeah the runway layout is basically LAX (same dimensions), with some CDG inspiration too 😊
hqou65z : Thanks! I will 😊
hqooceg : 🙏
hqou3nj : Between 5-30 depending on which area of the airport! 60 fps in other areas of the map though 😊
hqs4j2d : Thanks 😊 i actually did pursue an architecture career when i was younger, but eventually i chose the music instead. It’s very relaxing to have an outlet for this type of creativity though.
hqoh8lk : Thanks!
hqol8v3 : Thank you!
hqp2syc : Thank you! Prop limit isn’t an issue anymore, except for PC limitation ofc 😊
hqs4jhv : 😇
hqs438s : Thank you kindly! 🙏
hqoh01c : It does feel like it, this airport since nov 2018 to be exact :D I did another airport this size before then though so i have been building airports since 2017!
hqpentd : I’m a music teacher! Me neither really, that’s why it has taken me 3 years 😅
hqqll8c : Thanks, Yeah i might revisit and change some things!
hqqlima : It’s fully functional! You can see it in action in the links provided in the images 😊
hqqle4p : Thanks 😉 it takes up 9 tiles (the runways are 1:1 scaled to LAX)
hqs4bdl : Thank you 🙂 Yeah the rest of the city is awaiting, only done two (suburban/rural) areas so far.
hqs46uz : That’s how i roll 😂
hqs45s1 : Thanks! Yeah, that’s the plan (as far as my PC can stand it 😅)
hqs41at : Thank you! 🙏
hqs40di : Thank you! I will definately check it out 😊
hqs3xuq : I use PO mod to reshape/recolor/retexture any asset i want and combine them into unique ones. But i dont make any new buildings in the asset editor if that’s what you mean
hqs3rnj : Yep 🙈
hqs3h27 : I’ve tried to make it so but it’s far to big and complicated to put it on the workshop. I might have another go at it when im done recording next yt episode
hqs3av2 : Thank you! I’ve never had any problems saving, and the map had over 10k objects like the first week i worked on the airport. So it sounds more people have had problems with other mods or maybe that their PC couldnt handle it
hqs2ru4 : Yeah… might have to revisit and change some things 🙈
hqs50gt : Thanks! I look forward to it very much! I hope to implement a lot of it into my existing airport. Hopefully it won’t be too much work 😅
hqslrrg : Thanks, it was hard to make it look good 😅
hqs2pzr : I took inspiration from LAX and SFO initially, later on also CDG.
hqsui0f : Thanks! You can see them more clearly if you zoom in the closeup pics (pic 2-4) or follow the provided link to my yt channel. There i have extensive cinematics showing all the details. There are a lot of surfaces, lights, decals and lines that make up alot of those PO/prop numbers, and that’s what makes it look realistic 🙂
hqobrm9 : I see. 

How does your airport actively work with the games plane mechanics? Do they land at it? Take off? Passengers come in and get out?
hqprqps : Ohhhh I hope you love the newcoming DLC. Amazing job on this.
hqof6qr : I’m surprised you have enough space for the assets. I don’t think we have many details on the new dlc but I wonder if you’ll change anything
hqp6a6f : What oc u have
hqp6asa : Pc
hqph9tf : Well that makes much more sense! Lol I work on computers for a living. Play games at work occasionally and I have put up 100 hours total in CS in 2 years. I feel like I play way too much!. You had an extra year
hqpheac : I just looked. I'm up to 175 hours. Woah. Didn't even realize it
hqtg44r : and now? are u going to continue the map? Cause only with this airport my pc would explode
hqobyj1 : It’s fully functional, planes landing/taking off with all types of public transport to/from (and inside) the airport. You can watch it in the links provided in the images
hqofr01 : I will definately check it out, so i might change a few things!
hqtghub : Yeah i will continue with the city itself. It’s fine so far but i will see how much i can build before it becomes unplayable 😅
hqodpif : That is really cool. Well done!
hqoec16 : Thank you! 🙏

hqosama : I think districts are purely for you to provide different policies. As far as settling goes, cims usually look for services and just greater land value in general. For example, if you have zoned a large area, and you put a park down, you’ll see greater percentage of settling there. But, the district that falls on doesn’t have an effect. I’ve never seen this but there are policies that lead to a lower happiness score. So this might lead to lower land value and lead to less setting. But, as I’ve said, I’ve never seen that.
hqotrop : Nope; districts are just for policies, themes, and inventing sweet neighborhood names.

There are a few mods that affect services by district (ie, fire trucks can't cross district lines), but nothing that affects how cims settle, as far as I'm aware.
===============
rst3oi
hqonz7n : I’m so confused by what you are trying to say
hqoubcs : [deleted]
hqos2pm : OP is saying that if you build a neighborhood with 2x2 or 1x1 houses instead of 4x4, you can fit more population into the same space.

It's true if you're using Realistic Population. Not true in Vanilla (or rather, doesn't make enough of a difference to matter).
hqoo6t2 : Same here
hqoxtuy : A 1x1 residential only holds one family ~5 cims. It can not level up past 1 family. I’m not sure where there are getting their math from

Vanilla
hqovq0i : Ah I think I see what you see saying. They are saying zone 1x1 in a 4x4. But that only works if you don’t level up your buildings. A 4x4 fully leveled up fits  ~25 cims.
hqp9un8 : If I have a city of 100k on vanilla, would switching to true population fuck everything up? On the technical side, I mean. My city is about 80% low density residential.
hqp04bf : True, but a space that will hold four 4x4 houses will hold forty 1x1s (including all the roads required). A 4x4 averages 5 families, so that is 20 families vs 40 families.

\[I retracted my comment after I actually looked into the math\]
hqpb9d4 : You definitely *shouldn't* use the mod with existing cities. So says [the mod page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2025147082).
hqqqhjk : It shouldn’t break the file, but it will completely wreck the balance of the city.
hqrg9p2 : I did this with my city when I was about 45k but mostly high dense and it jumps pretty quickly to around 70k, but I had to remove a lot of industry. And I mean a lot. If u have some saved money I would've try, just keep old save. You should expects losing a lot of money due to road keeping costs as they will serve less people and your public transport will be needing rerouting as people will be more spread out.
hqp442h : I’m not following your math, but yes you are correct

I looked at a cluster of 4 level 5 low res. The total pop was 83. 

If we unwrap that into 1x1 64 houses with a ~192 cim population.
hqp4wbm : It's a bit less than that due to road adjacency requirements and other infrastructure overhead, actually.
hqp6zkv : Not following, if I take those 64 squares and put them into a straight line I have 64 households.
hqpjjzg : The pattern is:

RHHHHHHHHRRHHHHHHHHR  for 4x4

RHHRRHHRRHHRRHHRRHHR for 1x1

The pattern repeats enough times so that the roads at either end line up (so that both patterns cover exactly the same amount of ground -- 20x4 -- and includes all supporting roads). If you continue the pattern so that each one has 4 rows, that gives you a repeatable 'block' of houses.

The net result is:- four 4x4 houses @ 5 families: 20 families- forty 1x1 houses @ 1 family: 40 families

(Exact numbers in practice are going to vary. A single 4x4 can house 4 to 6 families, but it tends to average to 5.)
hqpmlfz : Oh I see what you were doing now. Nice
===============

hqocl4t : 1. Check for other universities in your city. Demolish if anyone is present.  
2. Use "Education Boost" policy. Highly recommended if you running campus development.
hqozho8 : What is your birthrate?

It's likely you had a boom before and you are in a slump because your birthrate fluctuates wildly. That will affect university numbers quite heavily.
hqojh56 : I demolished my only university when I started the campus. I'll check education boost and see if that makes any difference.

hqoqf38 : Have you changed over to the new Prop Anarchy mod?
hqr08w4 : After changing to Prop Anarchy i had the same problem with props and decals. Fortunately i didn’t have a lot of them, so i basically delete them. (You can move use “move it”) 

The real problem was to select them usin “move it”. It seems like these props physically on the old position,but visually somewhere offside. So to choose the props and decal i deselect all checkboxes except props and decals in “Move it” to select only them and tried to select a really big space on map. It worked! Only then i could select them in “move it” to do something (move or delete)

Possibly there is something wrong with scale of props and spaces between them. I noticed like props don’t fit their old position when i returned them. In new mod you can use coma key and point key to change scale of props. 

Hope it helps you not to delete and place all props again

hqqtc5o : Hmm. I don't see any UI for setting a "go to next step" condition for a particular type of traffic (e.g. specifically when a tram is waiting). A screenshot would be awesome.

Best I've come up with is, after each car step, add a tram step with min/max times of 0/6 seconds and which advances when no one is driving. That way, it gets immediately skipped over if no trams are there to start driving. But it doesn't interrupt the car step, so it doesn't prevent trams from waiting at the light (it just reduced their wait).

hqpwik0 : Very nice. It’s so stupid that vanilla bus stops have turnouts but still block traffic. The whole point of a turnout is to not block traffic.
hqppzdq : Can I forward your resume to my city's transit authority?
hqpfi6d : Oh now use intersection marking tool fillers to paint that whole lane red for bus lane!
hqporwx : In real life they're called [bus turnouts.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_turnout)
hqpf6or : Nicely done
hqqarzf : The Bus Zones in this game are so useles… The ones we have here in real life usually are large enough to fit the whol bus so it’s off the street and not blocking traffic or there isn’t a Bus Stop cutout on the sidewalk in the first place…
hqqdugf : The question that I have in mind is why would someone want to get off\\on the bus in the middle of nowhere.
hqpk5qb : nice move !!!
hqqbzcb : It's how they do it irl
hqpq1r0 : Ah, the ol' asymmetric road saving the day again!
hqprdn3 : That's a good idea! Now I'm thinking you could have half a block of road be 2-lanes/1-lane with the bus stop on the 2-lane side (like your video), which then transitions directly to 1-lane/2-lanes for the second half of the block (in other words, the 2-lane side switches sides) for a bus stop on the other side of the street, going in the opposite direction. I hope that makes sense. The idea being that you can keep a straight 3-lane-wide road segment the entire time, so the zoning doesn't get screwed up (i.e., stays straight and square) on both sides.
hqprh3y : Def gonna use this
hqpzk8u : Love it, I’m gonna use this.
hqqup4a : Simple yet effective
hqqv2ng : Smart !!!
hqr4t67 : Perfect 👌🏼
hqrlg3x : Thanks for the idea man
hqrmrgg : On busy roads its best to make a dedicated bus lane to avoid delays with busier stops.
hqs4al7 : Actually, the cars were causing traffic.
hqt8hi2 : Bustops in this game are so fckng annoying. They're absolutely gigantic yet only 1 bus can load / unload passangers at a time.
hqrbex7 : Why is there always a willow street?
hqrizxv : Where is this a bus stop to?
hqrrq4h : Neat!
hqscira : I'm not sure why more people don't do this, or just a single lane bus lane road loop.
hqq5xv5 : that's why the mods make this game so nice
hqqfomu : On the other hand, it's very realistic, as that's exactly what happens with many bus turnouts
hqqj1qb : I like to use a small bus only road that they turn off to as my stops, where theres space. At least its easy to put up a light for them.
hqptclx : why not :D
hqpxkyy : Not something a transit authority will love. This improves traffic flow but comes at a cost for bus operations IRL - the bus has to merge into traffic which causes delay. If it’s a busy bus route, the aggregate delay of the people on the bus often outweighs the time saved by people in vehicles. It works best on streets w/o a ton of traffic, just to the other side of a traffic light that allows the bus to merge, or at places where the bus will be stopped for a long period of time.
hqrsenj : Wait!? What country do you live in? These are common place in the U.K.
hqpg25o : I actually did, but the problem is that I can't get that small piece that gets created when adding a bus stop, I can't make that small zone red as well, that makes it look bad then.
hqprjkw : In my language they are bus bays
hqpg2pm : Thanks sir
hqqe9f2 : It wont be middle of nowhere for long
hqptkzb : I get what you mean, and I have that in my city
hqt8lj2 : that's where you say hello to mods
hqqusln : What mods do you use?
hqrf4cr : Only with bad drivers who don’t use the turnout as intended
hqq2uyz : You can do queue jumps if it's on a intersection with timed traffic lights, that's what my city does. Bus lane gets the green first for a few seconds to merge back in, then the main traffic goes.

On a stretch like this, you could give the bus priority by having the main lane merge with a give way to the bus lane becoming a regular lane. Not elegant, but the AI would respond how you want it.
hqqpuu9 : Where I live the law is you must stop to let busses merge.
hqpzqox : Where I live this is how it’s done 90% of the time.
hqrcfot : I can confirm this. My city is replacing bus pullouts on busy roads because people won't the busses out of them. Near the Northtown Mall a bus would be stopped for at least two minutes trying to merge back into traffic. That particular pullout is gone now and the bus just stops in the lane now.
hqq3f13 : And it also defeats accessibility - it is harder to stop the bus precisely near the pavement when additional maneuvres are needed.
hqqsgcz : Yeah, my city built some streets like that but removed the space after a few months. The bus needed a minute or two to merge back into traffic.
hqsp73w : While that is true, in my city there are signs that indicate to help the bus merge. Also it is common sense for the drivers here to let the bus in whenever needed.
hqsrx0m : Fix the damn people then. Not letting the bus merge is just deliberately destroying your social credit score over here.
hqrukjl : And the drivers just pull out regardless, seems to work.
hqpgeyy : With the latest IMT I am pretty sure you can click on the center road section between the nodes and colour the right lane using fillers... I have seen others do something similar...
hqprzfd : In my city apparently they're now ubereats driver parking 😂
hqr12q9 : How do you plan out bus routes ahead of time? That’s one aspect of my cities that I always flounder. Public transport.
hqs0lzz : Plus it creates a natural chicane, slowing traffic and making the area safer for pedestrians!
hqqzju1 : For this bus stop, all you need is Node Controller, Marking tool, and Network Extension 2 or Mass Transit DLC (not sure which of the two last ones)

Ps: and TMPE to make that lane available only for Buses
hqqf98d : What a smart solution!
hqqjlnt : Here we have it too.

Specially in places where the bus route turns left so the Bus gets time to cross both lanes of traffic without having to worry about other cars.

Taxis can also use the Bus lane
hqra7qo : Same where I live, but almost nobody cares and the police hardly enforce traffic laws.
hqsbslt : Here too but buses have a right of way unless speed limit is 70 kmh plus so merging isnt a problem
hqphyli : [This is all I could come up with](https://i.imgur.com/tHS0WYo.png)
hqsscok : I thought u just did assymetrical road .-.
hqpi59l : Ooooh, I see what you mean. Personally I still think this looks great! Tells users no go except busses!
hqpwmnj : I believe if you hold either alt or control you can drag the nodes meaning you can move the red further over
hqqnz9z : Instead of IMT, you can find asymmetrical roads with bus lanes in the workshop, and those have properly coloured bus bays. I've done something similar before with them, though with one way roads. Worked like a charm.
hqsnd5o : If you hold control and click and drag the line nodes you can move them to cover the bit that isn’t covered.
hqsswgq : Yeah I do that too. Works just fine in combo with TMPE
hqpinmo : I used TMPE to make that lane available only for buses
hqql5z8 : As a Seattleite with red bus lanes, I can say many drivers ignore it 🤗
hqpiqwx : Oh for sure! The paint does nothing. But from a visuals/asthetics/realism aspect it's nice!
hqpjcoo : Thank you, the red color made it beautiful and a touch of realism
hqpuobl : What I like to do is move the points in Intersection Marking Tool further out (I think it's click and hold with ctrl). At both ends the sidewalk gets painted red, too, but in most cases you can't really see it. And I think it looks better then leaving the space in front of the bus stop grey.
hqqzthi : Ye I did that, but as you say it paints the sidewalk as well, I kept it without color just like it is in my country

hqpff9q : Terrorism.
hqse2ha : Check if your station track is connected to a node that allows them to switch track, sometimes Node controller does the thing where it turns it into a normal node and thus trains need to do funky things when trying to enter the station

hqpjpdw : Someone correct me if I'm wrong but the Old Town policy removes all cars and trucks bar those serving buildings and residential. Could be something to consider
hqprtw7 : Yes you can but it requires mods. The 'Building spawn point' mod allows you to set a point for servicing, in other words you can place a building whenever you want and move the service point to an appropriate road. Also, there are zone-able pedestrian paths that could potentially work as well
hqphmw2 : Probably not since you need roads for zoning.
hqpjycz : No because you can't get emergency services without roads. Without services, your city fails. You can ban cars but you can't ban trucks and other commercial traffic.
hqqdfwy : I've used it, but I haven't checked closely how well it works. I'm curious if anyone has experience with it.
hqqenqe : Can delivery truck spawn points be moved underground?

I've also considered -- but never built -- keeping streets on the surface, but filling in an elevated surface and invisible walkways between the buildings, so it has the appearance of the street network being underground.
hqphscx : Is there any other way to get zoning?
hqqetjj : You can ban various vehicles per segment with the Traffic Manager mod.
hqsdzcw : It works, people despawned their cars in the start of my city if they couldn't find a parking spot and used public transport, walking or biking
hqqzyo1 : Hmmm, interesting. Not sure if spawn points work underground or not. As for your idea about the hidden roads, I've have completed an entire city like this before so it works! 

I pushed the roads down below terrain height and used surface networks to create a false floor. Invisible paths work perfectly and no roads/truck in sight!
hqpiz0u : You have to use a road with vanilla but you can ban cars and trucks which makes it pretty much walk only. At least as close as you can get
hqs03h1 : There are pedestrian paths they allow zoning, but I can't remember which dlc they are from. Assuming you mean 'vanilla' as 'no mods' and not 'no mods or any dlc'.
hqqfs56 : The city just won't survive. No vehicles means the trash won't get picked up, bodies won't be picked up, commercial goods won't be delivered to commercial zones, etc.
hqrfqw2 : Spawn points has an option to raise and lower the spawn point height. Can't think of any use for it other than to e.g. go underground!
hqpj35y : Do you think it would function? Like people could still go to work and leisure right?
hqpjhhs : Yes, people walk and bike everywhere. But adding pedestrian paths and bike paths sure help. Also, if you are going to ban cars, make sure you let people move in first, then you ban. I think deliveries still get sent and city services are unbananble.

hqpi2yh : I'm originally from Honolulu, lived a few years in Miami, San Juan (Puerto Rico), and currently in DC, I wanted to create something that blended all 4 cities, and here it is. The old town is based in Old San Juan (colonial Spanish era), and the newer parts are a mix of Downtown Honolulu, Miami Beach, and the following areas in San Juan: Condado, Santurce, Isla Verde, and the recently re-development of the Convention District. Not shown in the screenshots is the Metro, which I took from DC.

I did some terraform to maximize the coastline in my city and to fit the highway/airport.

hqqwlzh : It’s gloriously overbuilt, needlessly expensive, and will most certainly confuse drivers. I love it!
hqr18cm : Terrifyingly beautiful.
hqr1h83 : Is there a mod that lets you do that parallel road connecting to the roundabout? One of my main pet peeves in this game is the lack of merging lanes like that.

"Yea, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should."
hqsba7o : What the fuck
hqsbtx1 : Looks like you have some left turns that should be given permanent green arrows. Since they are on the opposite sides of the road during the middle bridge, they should be allowed to do the equivalent of a right on red. From that point, they don't cross anymore lanes of traffic

hqt4hzr : It is beautiful, but it makes my brain hurt.
hqt4s32 : Please don't give TXDOT any ideas.  They might actually try to build this IRL.
hqt8ekc : Well, that underloop violates the Diverging Diamond principle of no extra cross-overs, but this this C:S and cims don’t crash so who cares if it keeps traffic moving!
hqtcd4c : What does "single-point" mean here?

E:Autocorrect got me!
hqtjcwv : The only thing missing is the massive traffic back ups from random cims not using it properly.

hqpvctj : make one of these interchanges, but instead of accommodating 2 roads (main road & highway) , make it accommodate 3 roads (highway, main road 1, main road 2), for even more chaos
hqqbqs4 : You sir are playing this game right.
hqqvz5j : Upload a save game, I need to fix those two cross over points before they either kill somebody or your traffic percentage
hqreu7c : Now do it without traffic lights, idk more roundabouts inb4 biffa. 

Do you have a mod & custom content (& lighting settings like relight etc) list? How do you get the concrete and outlines so nice? I know IMT, node controller, TM:PE, move it! But it's so... crisp
hqtai94 : The public swimming pools in the roundabouts are a nice touch 👍
hqq1qjd : That would be perfect. I will live forever inside their minds.

hqrvwrj : I vote Austin Texas.
hqpr97k : What is a little pain in the face of glory?
hqpszwt : I wasnt, [crossposted it now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyskylines/comments/rt15rp/you_begged_me_not_to_yet_i_did_it_anyway/) Did I do it right?
hqqi2n4 : There is dirty dancing and then there is dirty engineering.
hqqhxsi : You thought that was water? Oh no, dont be silly, its 100% concentrated tears of local drivers.
hqpvh4s : It is too late. It has already transcendent any individual. You cannot kill an idea. Soon others will rise and carry the madness.
hqpv52e : It was u/Secret_FurryAccount's madness that drove me. It is his demented mind that deserves credit for dreaming up this beauty. I merely found way to bring it into reality.
hqr6y9e : No way, the overpasses are far too low for Houston
hqqi8nu : What did your cims do to you?
hqql5az : Jokes on you, my prison bed doesnt have a pillow.
hqrh6e7 : I got a [slightly concerning congratulatory call from Jeff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuYUoLM8BNA) over this interchange.
hqq6y9e : You sure its the interchange and not whatever it is you are drinking this NYE?
hqqyrtf : Happy New Year!
hqqm5e5 : I cant be responsible for spreading this disease. 

Also I dont know how and I am not sure if its worth the effort.
hqqs468 : I heard this subreddit liked interchanges so I put some interchanges into an interchange so you can interchange while you are interchanging.
hqqid5g : The Dark Interchange
hqqqz3y : Damn, did I go too far this time? Did I anger the Italian mafia?
hqqyn71 : Well I got a lot of things to overcompensate for.
hqr4w1z : I just used a little bit of move it and followed [YUMBLtv's Pinwheel tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcyRsMZkg4).
hqrvaen : [Ask and you shall receive.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2702926826) I have never done that, so I hope it works.
hqt96xu : If we dont use up our budget, they will lower it next year. We cant have that, gentlemen.
hqta9kp : There are some turns that have permanent green light.
hqtanj6 : That is a thing? I just wanted to make it prettier.
hqqihcl : I really hope somebody will find a way soon. We can go deeper.
hqqu7xw : Thats it, keep looking. Do you hear it? It is calling for you.
hqqucp7 : That is part of the experience.
hqqyvg0 : Somebody actually made a meme out of my interchange. There is a first for everything.
hqr4ph5 : "Those who play with the devil's toys will be brought by degrees to wield his sword" — R. Buckminster Fuller
hqrbsv5 : I am not going to bore you with all that nerd talk. All you need to know that all that technical mumbo jumbo translates to one thing and one thing only. The best damn interchange in the world.
hqrcsa9 : [This analysis](https://i.imgur.com/Y9OTfvi.png) should explain nothing, but the fact that I love eating colorful crayons.

Edit: Just realized I drawn the yellow line over the blue text. The blue circle says "Turbo Circle".
hqrdfl5 : What kind of university though? Social studies? Art?
hqt8g6a : Use your third eye to navigate this interchange. Trust in the traffic flow.
hqt8ior : Only losers use cloverleafs!
hqt8qpg : I dont, which one? Sounds fun.
hqt8w44 : Sometimes you have to create your own fun.
hqtagfi : Just Network Skins 2 for the asphalt color and Theme for the concrete color. Then IMT and NC for intersections.
hqtas2a : Way ahead of you [DS-PU/STCPDPCWS/SI](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2702926826).
hqtb4v4 : Cost: You cant afford it if you are asking  
Traffic flow: Yes  
Ease of Use: No  
Rating: Badass
hqtb8cm : Wow, that opens up all kind of new possibilities.
hqtbc2f : I wish I could upvote your comment thousand times. Legitimately made me laugh.
hqtbejv : Go on, call the cops, I dont care. They cant unrape your eyes.
hqtbo1j : Just almost.
hqpq1yt : They go away. Just anywhere that is not this interchange.

In all seriousness it is interchange testing map. Its trough traffic. There is no city.
hqqhpoi : Its as easy to remember as [the emergency number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWc3WY3fuZU).
hqqlk2d : What you dont see in the video is the huge traffic jam on the arterial road. To be fair I tested it with all 8 highways, so thats really high level of traffic. Its smooth, but it doesnt have enough capacity. IRL it would be solved by another through lane, but ingame the cars dont use it.

It is an efficient Service Interchange, but not an efficient System interchange.
hqqme95 : No way, this is one of the strong sides of this interchange. You pick a lane and then you live with your decision. Its like a lottery. Sometimes you get where you wanted to go. Sometimes you win a trip to somewhere you havent been before. But once you make that choice, your fate is sealed.
hqqyqjw : There are "reverse" or "inverse" roads on the workshop. Have a search and you will find a bunch of them to suit your needs.
hqrd7ut : I used [Inverted Large Avenue](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1174227939), but there are many others on workshop.
hqrhohp : I form light and create darkness, I make well-being and create calamity, I am the Lord, who does all these things.

Isaiah 45:7
hqrmtfm : Just stop and walk away. Easy.
hqrv7zg : Hey, again. I already told you though. Its Next2 equivalent + Inverted Large Avenue and this time I used reversed two lane road. I even uploaded it to workshop since people here asked for it [DS-PU/STCPDPCWS/SI](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2702926826), I think I linked all dependancies.
hqtaw3s : Just a tiny water source with Extra landscaping tools mod.
hqsr2fd : STARTED OUT AS A RESERVE
hqtcczy : Its traffic light controlled. Its perfectly safe! My favorite part is the fact that the Diverging bridge mitigates any benefit from the underpass windmill yet it still works flawlessly.
hqtfm4n : Single point? Its an interchange that has one single point where traffic meets. Obviously there are many points in this one, but it retains the design of the single point interchange.
hqtpe72 : You need to attend mandatory two day seminar to use this interchange.
hqqojwn : for it is you in this csl universe is of your own creation
hqt2q25 : Every day we drive further from god's light
hqsegu3 : No.
hqqzldh : Where do you go from here?
hqpvzjj : No, I dont think I will. It is time to let others shine. I will now finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.
hqpvedt : if your going to go all in, go ***all*** in
hqqyjyg : The diverging part of the interchange? Do you not know how it work?
hqrhhpb : I use pretty standard graphical stuff. Here is [great video quickly showcasing the effects of every graphical mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POYxl9tDVXA). Then it was just matter of playing with sliders on all of them to get something I liked. Then I customized my theme using Theme mixer 2.
hqtchtg : Those were originally just holes. The drivers filled them with tears.
hqsiylq : REMEMEBER ME! 🔥🔥🔥
hqprp7a : Sometimes I sit down and consider attempting to install these mods and do cool shit like this. But then I realized I just like appreciate the work of others more- keep that shit up. 
Imma go play Star Citizen and get my pain there lol
hqqzprf : Pain is temporary, traffic fixes are forever.
hqqkefx : Still fishable!
hqqia6j : I thrive on chaos.
hqrb6o8 : It definitely is. I need this in my Midwest city so bad.
hqte9z9 : Spoken like a true redditor
hqr7c9j : Nice I'll check that out, thanks!
hqsr0mb : I gotta get this
hqten70 : Yeah, they're for managing the water table I think
hqrds13 : 🤤
hqrle8q : Dual doctorate in civil engineering and performance art.
hqteobg : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2BMsHppIKM

There ya go.
hqpzfmw : Imagine you’re just cruising along on the highway in the middle of nowhere and you come across this insane intersection. Thinking you’ve arrived at a city or terminus of some sort you dutifully transverse the interchange. Less than a minute later you’re cruising along once again, wondering if that really happened.
hqsjw6g : Oh god. It’s perfect
hqrdtd1 : Huh. It was my understanding that all those roads used very hacky and bug-prone solutions to get inverted lanes, but yours here seems to work just fine. No issues?
hqsa5oq : You did. Why not upload the previous one to workshop as well?
hqrvbif : Sorry, I’m dumb, did you upload the previous one to workshop as well?
hqqop76 : No gods or kings, only civil engineers.
hqqzyzl : I go back to building sensible things in my city. The question is, where do you go from here? Join the Mad men cause!
hqq7tlh : well, i will do it then, despite the best wishes of the world, stay tuned (:
hqs3vn3 : But why are you grating the universe?

:p
hqqywyx : I’m referring to the crossing point in the centre of the bridge and the crossover point before the diamond on the right. 

They are places where either traffic lights will kill your throughput or the lack of them would kill people.
hqql2xk : Then go forth and make an interchange that overshadow all others. And summon me with u/Scoobz1961 when you do. I want to be there.
hqrboa6 : Well guys I tried - [DS-PU/STCPDPCWS/SI](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2702926826). Spend half an hour on it. I hope it works.

paging u/segin, u/FeistyHistorian, u/enesthememer
hqtfv7w : Thanks, man!
hqq148y : This interchange leads to [Interstate 60](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165832/).
hqredp6 : I dont see why any of those would be buggy. It is a simple asset edit. They work great and I never had a problem with them. The only issue I noticed is that the traffic lights are on the wrong side.

Edit: They dont use any solution. There is simply data that tells cars where the "lane" is on each asset. They simply put those lanes in each other's place. Done.
hqt9vje : Yeah, I could have now that I think about. It just didnt occur to me then. I dont like the asset editor and the hassle that comes with it so I most likely wont do it again.
hqsr7oa : Do civil engineers cry?
hqsgodz : How did you know that's their motto?
hqr0gwy : Way ahead of you! I mean, the room is a bit boring with all that white, and this pyjama is really restrictive, but the food's nice!
hqr0y7j : How could you go back to that after having a taste of reality?
hqq8gvj : Then tag me wit u/Scoobz1961 when you do. I want to be there.
hqrrvtr : We will watch your career with great interest
hqqztwj : You cant remove the one on the bridge. It wouldnt be a windmill anymore, plus there is already traffic light synched with the diverging lights. It works great.

You cant remove the other one because it would no longer be parclo. It is also synched to that same traffic light and works great.

This is interchange testing map. This is freeflowing system interchange worth of traffic going through arterial road of service interchange. There wont be more traffic than that in normal use and as you can see it isnt having any negative effect on the interchange.
hqscork : Thanks man!
hqt4vpj : Favorited and Subscribed. I gotta see if this works.
hqtfs5q : Will you pweeeease do it 🥺🥺🥺
hqsvdci : Only entities with souls cry, so no.
hqtbjx9 : Those two little salt water ponds in the middle of the pinwheels are a definitive proof they do.
hqr0m9h : One of us! One of us!
hqr0s83 : Question: would it cease to be a parclo if you split the lanes at the meeting point and sent one lane under the junction for the traffic leaving the junction?

Question 2: would it cease to be a windmill if the traffic did not pass under the bridge before joining the middle of the diamond and instead ramped up from the initial off ramp?
hqtaaob : Did it work?
hqtnsh4 : It was as unpleasant as the first time. Here it is [DS-PUPCTCDI](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?edit=true&id=2703731239). Hope it works
hqr3yxz : I dont have very good imagination and this is getting too hard to follow. Could you just paint what you mean [on top of this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/KNRPKCg.png)? Just good old crude mouse MSPaint style drawing.
hqtofw8 : I think it's missing a road(s) from the dependencies list. It doesn't show up in-game for me to place.
hqtqrln : You are right, I forgot Three lane Asymmetrical highway was custom and not part of Mass Transit. I updated it the asset, can you try it again?

Edit: [You can see all custom roads with RON.](https://i.imgur.com/0lBhNFE.png) (These are only the ground roads, there is an elevated reversed Reversed Two-lane Road and the four lane road is not part of this one, but the previous DS-PUPCTCDI)

hqptg1z : Try running a power line directly next to a zoned square.
hqq7ir8 : I'm not sure because it's a nightshot, but it seems that your city isn't connected to the highway, which at the moment is the only way into your city. Try connecting it up and people will start to move in.
hqprzvz : I always add parks and essential things the city requires for cims to move in. The city needs to have some desirability.
hqtdljs : It's weird but needs 9% and above employment

hqpyy3t : Awesome job with the realism. What is that power line / transformer (?) asset between the grand prix and big brick warehouse. I need it
hqsu5me : Beautiful work!
hqqwnxr : The short answer is: time/patience, mods that change the lighting and look of the game, and well made/chosen assets. Oh and a pretty damn hefty computer depending on what you wanna do ha.  
imo, that yellow-ish vanilla lighting, and the vanilla vehicles are the two most glaringly "cartoon" things in CS. There are at least a handful of non-cartoonish buildings...

The cross over type thing in the first pic works really well in this game, as long as TMPE is used to set it up properly.

hqsdtr3 : The tracks themselves need to have a station track variant, as the game spawns the vehicles on "stations", so check that? Also try and make it two way external connection, then connect it to a one way rail later

Also wait some time, sometimes it takes a bit of time for the game to recognize them, atleast for me that's been the case the last two cities ive made. Check (with the train line tool) if a connection is even possible from where you want to the end (that is to check if the end track is a station track or not)

There is also a mod that allows you to disable spawning of empty (or almost empty) trains, so that could help and another mod that is to configure outside connections might cause the game to spawn ghost vehicles even when there is no demand, because the mod code overrides the game code and thus creates entities which need to go to your stations even when empty/no demand for them, so check if you have them and set them accordingly

hqr8ykq : Nice job on White Rock and Langley!
hqrfr1u : What a delicious map. I love all those places because of their geography (like Vancouver, Portland, Coos Bay)
hqs7p4t : Looks expensive already!!
hqsfh3y : So I’m from Maple Ridge and I’d like to speak to the manager.


Just kidding - this is awesome!
hqrp44l : Washington or BC? looks great!
hqs0qta : It looks this good and it's not done yet. Imagine the finished product. Great work!
hqsixpu : Hey! What's my house doing there!!!!
hqq5hf0 : try make phoenix
hqsmrun : Maybe you can set lines of trees in combination with dirt roads and different land types to fill up the empty spots between the towns. I love it
hqtkknw : Wow nice
hqtow57 : Keep at it. It looks grear so far. Dont rush and make sure you create backup saves! Lots of them.

hqqcrjh : i only play sandbox. bc i just like to build and not worry about $ or not having the roads/buildings i wanna use.
hqqce6b : I do both. Some cities as full sandbox and some with the unlocking
hqqej09 : I unlock with time.  For me the game is all about going with the flow.
hqqs1b0 : How do you unlock everything at once?
hqr466s : There's an option in the content manager under mods. It's built in the vanilla game along with some other options like unlimited money.

hqqr05p : It’s kinda hard to tell what you based it off of sense there is a giant British monument and a giant Chinese monument
hqqdi9y : Does thst dam produce anything?
hqqjbi5 : Based on the skyline and island structure, New York?
hqrf0in : Lol if it was really Montreal, you’d have to fine that resto for having their open sign in English #pastagate
hqqcn1v : I find that when I build cities skyline world's the people get lazy and take transit everywhere. This city was made with the intention to have as many people walking in the downtown area as possible and thus does not have much transit downtownn.
To clairify, I have many commuter rail lines bringing suburbanites downtown, but not real transit other than bike lanes downtown. This forces people to walk or take their car.
hqqlxk4 : in order for people to choose to walk it must be convenient to walk
hqqs07o : How's the traffic flow? City looks great but traffic flow is always my problem in console.
hqs8gsu : That looks like Montréal. I can see my house from there.
hqqufri : Yeah I know :/. It's hard; console dosnt provide you with many options and mods.

Geographically it is very loosely based off Montreal (the bridges, European housing, the highways.
hqqi07t : a strain on the city budget
hqr4y5w : Nope it's to stop flooding
hqquvh4 : Close!  It's Montréal; bridges, islands, highways, skyline structure and European areas.
hqrrx1y : Je suppose que c'est vrai
hqqwt88 : Thanks! The traffic flow is 83% (I think).
You can see the traffic map on the third to last picture
hqsd0j9 : What area/borough
hqt2fxu : Looking at it now, I can kind of see that
hqqosee : Lolol. My thoughts, but.. Who knows? Happy new year.
hqr52sz : The floods probably are more of a strain
hqr92mv : Really?
It looks like New York to me.
hqshkra : I spent a bunch of time when I was younger in Montréal. My grandparents lived in Verdun and I had an aunt in Rosemont.

hqsch7r : It might be an unfinished line; you've placed the first stop by accident and exited the tool. Hide your functional lines, open the metro line tool, and click on the phantom stop to activate it and then whatever button you use to delete stops while in the tool (second mouse button on PC, no idea what it is on console), and it should go away.
hqqkwvx : Look at the metro routes, are they all complete?
hqrasxs : Open your transportation info panel. 

Go thru every transport option tab and look for any broken routes there and delete them.
hqrvvde : You can make for lines visible or invisible. Make them invisible till you find the dot and click on it.
hqqkz9v : Definitely. I even deleted them and re layed them all
hqql5mq : They all have passengers?
hqqmwih : Yep. There's only two lines, one clockwise one anticlockwise through 7 stations. I've check the trains themselves and stations and all showing usage

The click clack of a train is great noise to fall asleep to though. Just hope there are no level crossings that will require blowing that whistle at 3AM!
hqqtdn8 : And a small ski slope ⛷
hqqx3eg : No there are no grade crossings. The train goes through the entire neighborhood.

rt60oc
hqqrbuu : Love this Sim City 4 looking city. What kind of settings are you using? My screenshots never look this crisp
hqrfkjc : Loved the SC4 looking too! Very American and realistic city.
hqrgrrk : Kind of reminds me of downtown Detroit. I love it.
hqsexsn : Your city is everything wrong with modern American cities. Nonetheless the detail is incredible.
hqrmuru : What do you use for parking lots? I see a couple different ones I’m not used to so just curious
hqslrhk : No highways, dense city center, nice parks and developed waterfront, aside from the parking lots it looks fine to me
hqss3rc : W
hqsm8vh : "aside from parking lots"

Let's not just dismiss them like that.... they take up like 50% of space. As a result the city isn't walkable and a car centric depressing shithole. The parks don't make up for it.
hqsmbo0 : Saying that parking lots are “everything wrong” with modern American cities is inaccurate
hqsmki2 : Nope they're not "everything wrong with American cities" but they sure as hell are a bit part of the car dependency common to most American cities. And car dependency is bad.
hqsnbof : Sorry I wasn’t verbose enough about the parking lots
hqsng45 : Show more ✨ passion ✨ for the cause :)
===============
rt6c1a
hqs8jfh : Not enough parking lots.
hqrn5g2 : The Highway doesn't look ***quite*** destructive enough
hqsig1o : Is that a roundabout on the right? I thought they were rare in the US
hqs2d4z : Lol legit needs more highways. One to the sports field, lmfao a round-a-bout? Highway. Highways, more bridges and turn those farms into industrial, that’d be cool.
hqrd3ec : Make all the suburbs nightmarish grids, add a parking lot that's about 4 square miles, make the parks roughly 100sqr feet and only put one bus lane.
hqs636i : What map is this?
hqs6ikv : Looks a little like Oklahoma City. Good job!
hqs88it : Starting off great... But we have way more scrappers in any city that has them.
hqs8m9n : God I really want a story/campaign mode when the next game comes out because I feel like it would be a lot of fun to start out like this and navigate forward through new city expansion
hqsfsml : True, especially for the football field. Good choice!
hqsyf4v : Not enough highways, too many trees, too many places for people to walk. Not enough cars
hqszxe6 : Looking great. Nice tree and lighting choices.
hqt1zvv : I see a stroad perfect for a strip mall!
hqsrttv : They’re becoming popular in suburbs
hqredw6 : \*no bus lanes 😈

hqsdd2t : If i understand your problem, your unique buildings appear as scaffolding, or it shows up as if a zoned building is being built? Both could be a mod causing the trouble, the first could be file corruption, or conflicting naming for some reason, the second i have no explanation, but i would check recently added/updated mods or assets and go from there
 Since when does this happen, what are the unique buildings? Are you placing them from your unique buildings tab, or the find it tab?

hqst8oc : You started a month ago and now a million cims… wowzers
hqs36f8 : Its a mod that stands for Residential Industrial Commercial Office. You can adjust how many people work and live at RICO assets from the workshop.
hqsvb99 : I can't believe it myself. But now its at 970k. They were upset I increased their taxes.

rt8l78
hqrblyu : One of the best must have mods that I’m sure everyone will recommend is Traffic Manager: Presidential Edition, or TMPE
hqr8h1b : It’s a big question to tackle but I recommend taking a look at some fairly recent YouTube videos that can recommend a lot of the quality of life mods you’ll need.

Just wanted to say congrats as this was the game that made me get a PC as I could only do so much in this game on my MacBook. Enjoy it.
hqrbq0f : There are tons of mods and contents you can add to the game, it can be a bit oveerwhelming, so you will need to ask the question - what do you want right now? There's plenty of video on youtube covering "essential mod", "must have mod", "top mod" etc... Those are easy enough.

For a start, the MUST HAVE no matter what are : Loading Screen Mod, Move It, Find Road Anarchy 2, Find It 2

Then in term of assets, you will want to take time and look through workshop search result to find those suits the theme you wanted to build. Having a theme you want to stick to will make things easier, and avoid clogging up PC memory resources with items you don't need at all.

>Cyberpunk district theme

a building theme is only a preset file, it don't actually consist of the assets required for the theme to work correctly. You actually need to subscribe to hundreds of other assets in the collection provided by the author for it to work.

frankly, by the time you subscribed to tons of custom buildings, you might as well just plop them down rather than ask them to grow randomly. Especially when the big ones are always plop only, cannot grow.
hqrqs74 : Population mod
hqrd4g5 : I just came back to the game and node controller and intersection marking tool changed my life.
hqrfxs7 : It’s quite literally a game changer in all the best ways.

hqs3naq : Looks like you're zoning smaller lots to squeeze more families in to the area, that's good. 
Once you get to ~6.5k pop you can get high density, that's much higher density and your city can take off then.

Commercial need is basically just entertainment need and industry is basically just employment. So if you zone commercial to cover the entertainment you tend to cover the jobs too.

Are you also playing with the rebalanced industries and life cycle mods as recommended?
hqrz0ss : 

My traffic has been at 85-90 precent because of an efficient roundabout
hqsmp0h : Is this the mod? https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2025147082

Looks interesting.
hqsjxcg : Can you give the link of that mod please.
hqskuub : I’m gonna completely ignore your statement and just say that LUT looks super realistic!
hqtdrkh : Only if you use exclusionary zoning in your city to prohibit multifamily housing. It matches IRL cities with endless suburban sprawl. Your commercial and industrial districts will also look bigger when surrounded by very large parking lots.
hqrrj83 : [removed]
hqtrsnr : That's good, but depending on a single roundabout to keep you afloat might not be a good idea as you scale up your city

hqs4vfo : Not to burst your bubble or anything but no mater what you do you won't have problems at 2k population.

Problems come with numbers and complexity as the city grows.

This isn't scalable btw.
hqruazz : to summarize: I use a "Cascading Yield" system, which means there are no stoplight intersections at all.

the tetriary (1 lane 1 way) roads yield to the secondary (2 lane 1 way) roads, which yield to the primary road (4 lane 2 way) with connection through single and 2 lane roads.

the bunchup near the highway is due to that being where I decided to put a side road for the power plant, which is a edited version of the oil plant that "supposedly" runs on Hydrogas, which is a real life water based fuel, which also does not produce pollution.
hqsrbw2 : U only have 2k

You should try it at 50k xd
hqsra8z : Exactly what you say
hqrujz9 : eventually I plan to use buses to improve it even further by giving them dedicated roads to traverse between the residential and industrial areas, which should reduce private vehicle traffic considerably.

out of frame is the other side of the highway intersection, which just loops back around.
===============
rtcre5
hqs4ctn : It makes the number of households per building into a volume calculation. Low density is always just one household per house, high density holds much more.

Workplaces like industrial and commercial employ way more people too, so the demand levels will seem strange.

Can be a bit of a slog to unlock things until you get to high density zoning, but I think the mod is great overall.
hqshi2x : You get comercial zones with a realistic demand of employes:
-15 employees for 4x4 Shops for example.
-with offices you can get into the hundreds of employee which is very realistic
-with high residential buildings, you get get like 60 familie, 30, way morw than vanilla, again, realistic.

Ps: every bulding is customizabile so you can ammend the cims nbers per bulding as you like

Hope this helps.
hqtc4l0 : Yes.

Low density will decrease. Single family homes are just that.  
High density will increase. Highrise apartment blocks house a lot of people.

Employers (commercial, industrial, office) will generally employ a lot more people.

Definitely a strong design, the...shaft of your city could use a thicker road, some might say an 6 lane is best, but I think a 4 lane is totally more than adequate and I don't care what anyone else says.

hqtpif2 : How’s the land value?
hqsczm9 : Did you turn on that policy?
hqseef2 : Nice industrial building you have next to residential
hqsj31o : They want more services. Fire, police, schools etc.
hqsslq0 : Yes
hqssp3b : Thanks. Its actually a huge recycling facility.
hqssrli : They are spoiled. They have access to good schools, healthcare, mass transportation, and emergency services.
hqsv024 : Then turn off the policy that makes them pay higher taxes?
hqsvco5 : I actually get a rise out of it 😂
===============
rtdkjc
hqs880r : I've had it happen quite a few times. Most recently, the problem ended up being a one way road facing the wrong direction
hqsml8m : The recycling center is not finding a route to the destination, i would recommend to move the center around some and see if something happens. If it's still not finding a route, i would check all the roads so that it's possible for the trucks to drive to the houses.
hqsr52q : Look around the city. I posted a similar problem here a  couple of weeks back.

It is because one of the buildings requiring service is inaccessible, somehow. It will take time to find but that is the only way to save the city.
hqs6wf8 : Is there a way for the recycling center trucks to actually get to those houses?
hqsd1o7 : Try moving the building by one square or to another place, solved a similar problem for me
hqsfonh : Do you have another facility not connected to this road network, such as one in a island town or something of the sort. 

I’ve had this happen and I found that in my case the isolated island town I made was the culprit, if you connect then it might fix things.
hqsu1bx : This 1-0-1 vehicle in use count at any service or building that can spawn a vehicle is a well known issue with the AI being unable to plot a path to its target so it despawns vehicle and tries again ... but targets the same building again and again and never moves on to the next target requiring its truck. 

You can sometimes bump the AI targeting along by turning building off/on or delete and replace it or move it to new location but doing this usually will see the problem come back eventually when the problem target building is eventually attempted to be targeted again. 

It’s usually a bad segment or layout of one way road that is letting traffic into an area but not back out cause the services need to be able to return to facility too.   Or a large intersection (or tmpe settings) or road nodes are too close together that is confusing the AI.  But it can be as simple as a building not properly snapped to a road or the entrance point where vehicle enter exit being right at a road node messing up the ai ability to get vehicles in or out 

It can be hard to find the problem when this issue comes up, especially if city is big, and it’s usually something really dumb that you’ve overlooked 10 times already.  You’ll have to take a careful look at the city and it’s road layouts etc but you’ll eventually find the issue.
hqs8ljy : I’ll check that
hqs72ck : Yeah all of the city services are doing thid
hqs753g : Weird, do you use mods at all?
hqs7kyh : Yeah I’ve got a few but they shouldn’t conflict
hqs7rnm : Well, I mean, I guess I'd try turning them off and on one at a time until you see which one is causing the issue, then maybe looking for a replacement mod
hqs8k29 : Yeah good idea, I’ll try that
